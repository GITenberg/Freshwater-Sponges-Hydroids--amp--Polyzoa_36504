<h3 class="p4">EDITOR'S PREFACE.</h3>

<p class="p2">Dr. N. Annandale's volume on the Freshwater <span
class="smcap">Sponges</span>, <span class="smcap">Polyzoa</span>, and
<span class="smcap">Hydrida</span> contains an account of three of the
chief groups of freshwater organisms. Although he deals mainly with
Indian forms the book contains an unusually full account of the
life-history and bionomics of freshwater Sponges, Polyzoa, and
Hydrozoa.</p>

<p class="p2">I have to thank Dr. Annandale for the great care he has
taken in the preparation of his manuscript for the press, and also the
Trustees of the Indian Museum, Calcutta, for their kindness in placing
material at the disposal of the Author.</p>

<h3 class="p4">GENERAL INTRODUCTION<br /> TO THE VOLUME.</h3>

<p class="p2">Although some zoologists have recently revived the old
belief that the sponges and the c&oelig;lenterates are closely allied,
no one in recent times has suggested that there is any morphological
relationship between either of these groups and the polyzoa. Personally
I do not think that any one of the three groups is allied to any other
so far as anatomy is concerned; but for biological reasons it is
convenient to describe the freshwater representatives of the three
groups in one volume of the "Fauna."</p>

<p>Indeed, I originally proposed to the Editor that this volume should
include an account not only of the freshwater species, but of all those
that have been found in stagnant water of any kind. It is often
difficult to draw a line between the fauna of brackish ponds and marshes
and that of pure fresh water or that of the sea, and this is
particularly the case as regards the estuarine tracts of India and
Burma.</p>

<p>Pelseneer<a name="fnanchor_A" id="fnanchor_A"></a><a
href="#footnote_A" class="fnanchor"><sup>[A]</sup></a> has expressed the
opinion that the Black Sea and the South-east of Asia are the two
districts in the world most favourable for the study of the origin of a
freshwater fauna from a marine one. The transition in particular from
the Bay of Bengal, which is much less salt than most seas, to the
lower<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg
2]</a></span>reaches of the Ganges or the Brahmaputra is peculiarly
easy, and we find many molluscs and other animals of marine origin in
the waters of these rivers far above tidal influence. Conditions are
unfavourable in the rivers themselves for the development and
multiplication of organisms of many groups, chiefly because of the
enormous amount of silt held in suspension in the water and constantly
being deposited on the bottom, and a much richer fauna exists in ponds
and lakes in the neighbourhood of the rivers and estuaries than in
running water. I have only found three species of polyzoa and three of
sponges in running water in India, and of these six species, five have
also been found in ponds or lakes. I have, on the other hand, found
three c&oelig;lenterates in an estuary, and all three species are
essentially marine forms, but two have established themselves in ponds
of brackish water, one (the sea-anemone <i>Sagartia schilleriana</i>)
undergoing in so doing modifications of a very peculiar and interesting
nature. It is not uncommon for animals that have established themselves
in pools of brackish water to be found occasionally in ponds of fresh
water; but I have not been able to discover a single instance of an
estuarine species that is found in the latter and not in the former.</p>

<p>For these reasons I intended, as I have said, to include in this
volume descriptions of all the c&oelig;lenterates and polyzoa known to
occur in pools of brackish water in the estuary of the Ganges and
elsewhere in India, but as my manuscript grew I began to realize that
this would be impossible without including also an amount of general
introductory matter not justified either by the scope of the volume or
by special knowledge on the part of its author. I have, however, given
in the introduction to each part a list of the species found in stagnant
brackish water with a few notes and references to descriptions.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Biological Peculiarities of the
Sponges, C&oelig;lenterates, and Polyzoa of Fresh Water.</span></p>

<p>There is often an external resemblance between the representatives of
the sponges, c&oelig;lenterates, and polyzoa that causes them to be
classed together in popular phraseology as "zoophytes"; and this
resemblance is not merely a superficial one, for it is based on a
similarity in habits as well as of habitat, and is correlated with
biological phenomena that lie deeper than what are ordinarily called
habits. These phenomena are of peculiar interest with<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> regard to
difficult questions of nutrition and reproduction that perhaps can only
be solved by a close study of animals living together in identical
conditions and exhibiting, apparently in consequence of so living,
similar but by no means identical tendencies, either anatomical or
physiological, in certain directions.</p>

<p>One of the most important problems on which the study of the sponges,
c&oelig;lenterates, and polyzoa of stagnant water throws light is that
of the production of resting buds and similar reproductive bodies
adapted to withstand unfavourable conditions in a quiescent state and to
respond to the renewal of favourable conditions by a renewed growth and
activity.</p>

<p>Every autumn, in an English pond or lake, a crisis takes place in the
affairs of the less highly organized inhabitants, and preparations are
made to withstand the unfavourable conditions due directly or indirectly
to the low winter temperature of the water: the individual must perish
but the race may be preserved. At this season <i>Hydra</i>, which has
been reproducing its kind by means of buds throughout the summer,
develops eggs with a hard shell that will lie dormant in the mud until
next spring; the phylactolæmatous polyzoa produce statoblasts, the
ctenostomatous polyzoa resting-buds ("hibernacula"), and the sponges
gemmules. Statoblasts, hibernacula, and gemmules are alike produced
asexually, but they resemble the eggs of <i>Hydra</i> in being provided
with a hard, resistant shell, and in having the capacity to lie dormant
until favourable conditions return.</p>

<p>In an Indian pond or lake a similar crisis takes place in the case
of most species, but it does not take place at the same time of year in
the case of all species. Unfortunately the phenomena of periodic
physiological change have been little studied in the freshwater fauna of
most parts of the country, and as yet we know very little indeed of the
biology of the Himalayan lakes and tarns, the conditions in which
resemble those to be found in similar masses of water in Europe much
more closely than they do those that occur in ponds and lakes in a
tropical plain. In Bengal, however, I have been able to devote
considerable attention to the subject, and can state definitely that
some species flourish chiefly in winter and enter the quiescent stage at
the beginning of the hot weather (that is to say about March), while
others reach their maximum development during the "rains" (July to
September) and as a rule die down during winter, which is the driest as
well as the coolest time of year.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg
4]</a></span>The following is a list of the forms that in Bengal are
definitely known to produce hard-shelled eggs, gemmules, resting-buds,
or statoblasts only or most profusely at the approach of the hot weather
and to flourish during winter:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent5a"><i>Spongilla carteri.</i></p>
<p class="indent5b"><i>Sponging alba.</i></p>
<p class="indent5b"><i>Spongilla alba</i> var. <i>bengalensis</i>.</p>
<p class="indent5b"><i>Spongilla crassissima.</i></p>
<p class="indent5b"><i>Hydra vulgaris.</i></p>
<p class="indent5b"><i>Victorella bengalensis.</i></p>
<p class="indent5b"><i>Plumatella fruticosa.</i></p>
<p class="indent5b"><i>Plumatella emarginata.</i></p>
<p class="indent5c"><i>Plumatella javanica.</i></p>

<p>The following forms flourish mainly during the "rains":&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent5a"><i>Spongilla lacustris</i> subsp.
   <i>reticulata</i>.</p>
<p class="indent5b"><i>Trochospongilla latouchiana.</i></p>
<p class="indent5b"><i>Trochospongilla phillottiana.</i></p>
<p class="indent5c"><i>Stolella indica.</i></p>

<p>The following flourish throughout the year:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent5a"><i>Spongilla proliferens.</i></p>
<p class="indent5c"><i>Hislopia lacustris.</i></p>

<p>It is particularly interesting to note that three of the species that
flourish in the mild winter of Bengal, namely <i>Hydra vulgaris</i>,
<i>Plumatella emarginata</i>, and <i>P. fruticosa</i>, are identical
with species that in Europe perish in winter. There is evidence,
moreover, that the statoblasts of the genus to which two of them belong
burst more readily, and thus give rise to new colonies, after being
subjected to a considerable amount of cold. In Bengal they only burst
after being subjected to the heat of the hot weather. Does extreme heat
have a similar effect on aquatic organisms as extreme cold? There is
some evidence that it has.</p>

<p>The species that flourish in India during the rains are all forms
which habitually live near the surface or the edge of ponds or puddles,
and are therefore liable to undergo desiccation as soon as the rains
cease and the cold weather supervenes.</p>

<p>The two species that flourish all the year round do not, properly
speaking, belong to one category, for whereas <i>Hislopia
lacustris</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg
5]</a></span> produces no form of resting reproductive body but bears
eggs and spermatozoa at all seasons, <i>Spongilla proliferens</i> is a
short-lived organism that undergoes a biological crisis every few weeks;
that is to say, it begins to develop gemmules as soon as it is fully
formed, and apparently dies down as soon as the gemmules have attained
maturity. The gemmules apparently lie dormant for some little time, but
incessant reproduction is carried on by means of external buds, a very
rare method of reproduction among the freshwater sponges.</p>

<p>The facts just stated prove that considerable specific idiosyncrasy
exists as regards the biology of the sponges, hydroids, and polyzoa of
stagnant water in Bengal; but an even more striking instance of this
phenomenon is afforded by the sponges <i>Spongilla bombayensis</i> and
<i>Corvospongilla lapidosa</i> in Bombay. These two sponges resemble one
another considerably as regards their mode of growth, and are found
together on the lower surface of stones. In the month of November,
however, <i>C. lapidosa</i> is in full vegetative vigour, while <i>C.
bombayensis</i>, in absolutely identical conditions, is already reduced
to a mass of gemmules, having flourished during the "rains." It is thus
clear that the effect of environment is not identical in different
species. This is more evident as regards the groups of animals under
consideration in India (and therefore probably in other tropical
countries) than it is in Europe. The subject is one well worthy of study
elsewhere than in India, for it is significant that specimens of <i>S.
bombayensis</i> taken in November in S. Africa were in a state of
activity, thus contrasting strongly with specimens taken at the same
time of year (though not at the same season from a climatic point of
view) in the Bombay Presidency.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Geographical Distribution of
the Indian Species.</span></p>

<p>The geographical distribution of the lower invertebrates of fresh and
of stagnant water is often an extremely wide one, probably because the
individual of many species exists at certain seasons or in certain
circumstances in a form that is not only resistant to unfavourable
environment, but also eminently capable of being transported by wind or
currents. We therefore find that some genera and even species are
practically cosmopolitan in their range, while others, so far as our
knowledge goes, appear to have an extraordinarily discontinuous
distribution. The latter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6"
id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> phenomenon may be due solely to our
ignorance of the occurrence of obscure genera or species in localities
in which they have not been properly sought for, or it may have some
real significance as indicating that certain forms cannot always
increase and multiply even in those localities that appear most suitable
for them. As an example of universally distributed species we may take
the European polyzoa of the genus <i>Plumatella</i> that occur in India,
while of species whose range is apparently discontinuous better examples
could not be found than the sponges <i>Trochospongilla pennsylvanica</i>
and <i>Spongilla crateriformis</i>, both of which are only known from N.
America, the British Isles, and India.</p>

<p>My geographical list of the species of sponges, c&oelig;lenterates,
and polyzoa as yet found in fresh water in India is modelled on Col.
Alcock's recently published list of the freshwater crabs (Potamonidæ) of
the Indian Empire<a name="fnanchor_B" id="fnanchor_B"></a><a
href="#footnote_B" class="fnanchor"><sup>[B]</sup></a>. I follow him in
accepting, with slight modifications of my own, Blanford's
physiographical rather than his zoogeographical regions, not because I
think that the latter have been or ought to be superseded so far as the
vertebrates are concerned, but rather because the limits of the
geographical distribution of aquatic invertebrates appear to depend on
different factors from those that affect terrestrial animals or even
aquatic vertebrates.</p>

<p>"Varieties" are ignored in this list, because they are not considered
to have a geographical significance. The parts of India that are least
known as regards the freshwater representatives of the groups under
consideration are the valley of the Indus, the lakes of Kashmir and
other parts of the Himalayas, the centre of the Peninsula, and the basin
of the Brahmaputra. Those that are best known are the districts round
Bombay, Calcutta, Madras and Bangalore, Travancore and Northern
Tenasserim. Little is known as regards Ceylon, and almost nothing as
regards the countries that surround the Indian Empire, a few species
only having been recorded from Yunnan and the Malay Peninsula, none from
Persia, Afghanistan, or Eastern Turkestan, and only one from Tibet.
Professor Max Weber's researches have, however, taught us something as
regards Sumatra and Java, while the results of various expeditions to
Tropical Africa are beginning to cast light on the lower invertebrates
of the great lakes in the centre of that continent and of the basin of
the Nile.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg

the Himalayas and the hills of Southern India. No sponge has been found

a variety of <i>H. oligactis</i> was taken by Capt. F. H. Stewart in
Tibet at an altitude of about 15,000 feet. <i>Plumatella diffusa</i>
flourishes at Gangtok in Sikhim (6,100 feet), and I have found
statoblasts of <i>P. fruticosa</i> in the neighbourhood of Simla on the
surface of a pond situated at an altitude of about 8,000 feet; Mr. R.

<p>The most striking feature of this list is the evidence it affords as
to the distinct character of the fauna of the Malabar Zone, a feature
that is also remarkably clear as regards the Potamonidæ, one genus of
which (<i>Gecarcinucus</i>) is peculiar, so far as India is concerned,
to that zone. As regards the sponges we may note the occurrence of no
less than three species of the subgenus <i>Stratospongilla</i>, which
has not been found elsewhere in India except on one occasion in Mysore,
and of a species of the genus <i>Corvospongilla</i>, which is unknown
from the rest of Peninsular India and from the Himalayas. The genus
<i>Pectispongilla</i> is only known from the Malabar Zone. Among the
polyzoa the genus <i>Fredericella</i><a name="fnanchor_D"
id="fnanchor_D"></a><a href="#footnote_D"
class="fnanchor"><sup>[D]</sup></a> appears to be confined, so far as
the Indian and Burmese fauna is concerned, to the Malabar Zone, and the
same is true as regards the group of species to which <i>Plumatella
tanganyikæ</i>, an African form, belongs.</p>

<p>A further examination of the list of Malabar species and a
consideration of allied forms shows that the majority of the forms
restricted to the Malabar Zone are either African or else closely allied
to African forms. The genus <i>Corvospongilla</i>, except for one
Burmese species, is otherwise peculiar to Tropical Africa; while
<i>Stratospongilla</i>, although not confined to Africa, is more
prolific in species in that continent than in any other. <i>Spongilla
(Stratospongilla) bombayensis</i> has only been found in Bombay, the
Western Ghats, Mysore, and Natal, and <i>Plumatella tanganyikæ</i> only
in the Western Ghats and Central Africa. The genus <i>Fredericella</i>
(which also occurs in Europe, N. America, and Australia) is apparently
of wide distribution in Africa, while <i>Lophopodella</i> (which in
India is not confined to the Malabar Zone) is, except for a Japanese
race of the Indian species, restricted outside India, so far as we know,
to East Africa.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg
11]</a></span> A less definite relationship between the sponges and
polyzoa of the Malabar Zone and those of countries to the east of India
is suggested by the following facts:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote_b">(1) The occurrence of the genus
<i>Corvospongilla</i> in Burma;<br />

(2) the occurrence of the subgenus <i>Stratospongilla</i> in Sumatra,
China, and the Philippines;<br />

(3) the occurrence of a race of <i>Lophopodella carteri</i> in Japan;<br
/>

(4) the occurrence of a species allied to <i>Plumatella tanganyikæ</i>
in the Philippines.</p>

<p>It will be noted that in each of these instances the relationship
extends to Africa as well as to the Eastern countries, and is more
marked in the former direction. The species of <i>Stratospongilla</i>,
moreover, that occurs in Sumatra (<i>S. sumatrensis</i>) also occurs in
Africa, while those that have been found in China and the Philippines
are aberrant forms.</p>

<p>At first sight it might appear that these extra-Indian relationships
might be explained by supposing that gemmules and statoblasts were
brought to the Malabar Coast from Africa by the aërial currents of the
monsoon or by marine currents and carried from India eastwards by the
same agency, this agency being insufficient to transport them to the
interior and the eastern parts of the Peninsula. The work of La Touche<a
name="fnanchor_E" id="fnanchor_E"></a><a href="#footnote_E"
class="fnanchor"><sup>[E]</sup></a> on wind-borne foraminifera in
Rajputana is very suggestive in this direction; but that the peculiar
sponge and polyzoon fauna of Malabar is due to the agency either of wind
or of marine currents may be denied with confidence, for it is a
striking fact that most of the characteristic genera and subgenera of
the Zone have resting reproductive bodies that are either fixed to solid
objects or else are devoid of special apparatus to render them light.
The former is the case as regards all species of <i>Corvospongilla</i>
and all Indian and most other species of <i>Stratospongilla</i>, the
gemmules of which not only are unusually heavy but also adhere firmly;
while the statoblasts of <i>Fredericella</i> have no trace of the
air-cells that render the free statoblasts of all other genera of
phylactolæmatous polyzoa peculiarly light and therefore peculiarly
liable to be transported by wind.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg
12]</a></span>A true <ins title="'geographica' in the
original">geographical</ins> or geological explanation must therefore be
sought for the relationship between the sponges and polyzoa of Malabar,
of Africa, and of the Eastern countries&mdash;a relationship that is
well known to exist as regards other groups of animals. No more
satisfactory explanation has as yet been put forward than that of a
former land connection between Africa and the Malaysia through Malabar
at a period (probably late Cretaceous) when the Western Ghats were much
higher than they now are<a name="fnanchor_F" id="fnanchor_F"></a><a
href="#footnote_F" class="fnanchor"><sup>[F]</sup></a>.</p>

<p>There is little to be said as regards the distribution of the
sponges, hydroids, and polyzoa of fresh water in other parts of India.
It may be noted, however, that the species known from the Punjab are all
widely distributed Palæarctic forms, and that the genus <i>Stolella</i>
is apparently confined to the Indo-Gangetic Plain. Two species of sponge
are peculiar to Lower Burma, one of them (<i>Corvospongilla
burmanica</i>) representing the geographical alliance already discussed
as regards the Malabar Zone, the other (<i>Tubella vesparioides</i>)
closely related to a Malaysian species (<i>T. vesparium</i> from Borneo)
and perhaps representing the northern limit of the Malaysian element
well known in the fauna of Lower Burma. Of the sponges and polyzoa of
Ceylon we know as yet too little to make it profitable to discuss their
affinities. All that have as yet been discovered occur also in
Peninsular India; nor do they afford any evidence of a connection with
the Malabar Zone.</p>

<p>The question of the geographical range of the sponges, hydroids, and
polyzoa of brackish water may be considered briefly, for it is of
importance in considering that of those which are confined to fresh
water. Some of these species from brackish water (e.&nbsp;g.,
<i>Membranipora lacroixii</i>) are identical with others (e.&nbsp;g.,
<i>Victorella bengalensis</i> and <i>Bowerbankia caudata</i> subsp.
<i>bengalensis</i>) closely related to European forms. Others again
(e.&nbsp;g., <i>Loxosomatoides colonialis</i> and <i>Sagartia
schilleriana</i>) are known as yet from the Ganges delta only. In our
ignorance of the Indian representatives of the groups to which they
belong, it is impossible to assert that their distribution is actually
so restricted as it seems.</p>

<p>In order to avoid constant repetition as regards the conditions that
prevail at the places most frequently mentioned in this volume, a few
details as regards them may be conveniently stated here.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Lower Bengal.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Calcutta</span> is situated on the River Hughli
at a point about 90 miles from the open sea. The water of the river is
practically fresh, but is strongly affected by the tides; it is always
turbid and of a brownish colour. The river, however, is not a good
collecting ground for sponges, c&oelig;lenterates, and polyzoa, and none
of the species described in this volume have been obtained from it. It
is in the Calcutta "tanks" that most of my investigations have been
made. These tanks are ponds, mostly of artificial origin, very numerous,
of varying size but never very large or deep. Most of them contain few
solid objects to which sedentary organisms can fix themselves, and such
ponds are of course poor in sponges and polyzoa. Others, however,
support a prolific growth of weeds such as <i>Pistia stratiotes</i>,
<i>Lemna</i>, and <i>Limnanthemum</i>, and a few have brickwork or
artificial stonework at their sides. In those parts of the town that
approach the Salt Lakes (large lagoons and swamps of brackish water
connected with the sea by the Mutlah River) the water of the ponds is
slightly brackish and permits few plants except algæ to flourish. Few of
the bigger tanks ever dry up. The best of the tanks from the
sponge-collector's point of view, so far as I have been able to
discover, is the one in the compound of the Indian Museum. It enjoys all
the advantages of light and shade, solid supports, prolific aquatic
vegetation, considerable depth, and the vicinity of human dwellings that
seem to be favourable to the growth of sponges, no less than nine
species of which, representing three genera and two subgenera, grow
abundantly in it. <i>Hydra</i> also flourishes in this pond, but for
some reasons there are few polyzoa. The phylactolæmatous species of the
latter group, however, are extraordinarily abundant in one of the tanks
in the Zoological Gardens at Alipore. In this tank, which unlike the
Museum tank is directly connected with the river, no less than six
species and varieties of the genus <i>Plumatella</i> have been found
growing together on sticks, floating seeds, and water-plants. Except
<i>Hislopia</i>, which is common on <i>Vallisneria</i> in one tank on
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg
14]</a></span> Maidan (opposite the Bengal Club), the ctenostomes of
stagnant water are only found in the tanks near the Salt Lakes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Port Canning</span> is situated on the Mutlah
River about 30 miles from Calcutta and about 60 from the open sea. The
Mutlah is really a tidal creek rather than a river, in spite of the fact
that it runs for a considerable number of miles, and its waters are
distinctly brackish. Water taken from the edge at Port Canning in March
was found to contain 25.46 per thousand of saline residue. The
interesting feature of Port Canning, however, is from a zoological point
of view not the Mutlah but certain ponds of brackish water now
completely separated from it, except occasionally when the river is in
flood, but communicating regularly with it in the memory of living
persons. These ponds, which were apparently not in existence in 1855,
have on an average an area of about half an acre each, and were
evidently formed by the excavation of earth for the construction of an
embankment along the Mutlah. They are very shallow and lie exposed to
the sun. The salinity differs considerably in different ponds, although
the fauna seems to be identical; the water of one pond was found to
contain 22.88 per thousand of saline residue in May, 20.22 per thousand
in March, and 12.13 in December. A second pond in the neighbourhood of
the first and apparently similar to it in every way contained only 9.82
per thousand in July, after the rains had broken. The fauna of these
ponds includes not only a freshwater sponge (<i>Spongilla alba</i> var.
<i>bengalensis</i>) but also many aquatic insects (<i>e.&nbsp;g.</i>,
larvæ of mosquitos and of <i>Chironomus</i> and several species of
beetles and Rhynchota); while on the other hand essentially marine
c&oelig;lenterates (<i>Irene ceylonensis</i>, etc.) and worms
(<i>e.&nbsp;g.</i>, the gephyrean <i>Physcosoma lurco</i><a
name="fnanchor_G" id="fnanchor_G"></a><a href="#footnote_G"
class="fnanchor"><sup>[G]</sup></a>) form a part of it, together with
forms of intermediate habitat such as <i>Bowerbankia caudata</i> subsp.
<i>bengalensis</i>, <i>Victorella bengalensis</i>, and several fish and
crustacea common in brackish water.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Orissa.</i></p>

<p>Orissa may be described in general terms as consisting of the coastal
area of Bengal south of the Gangetic delta. It extends in inland,
however, for a considerable distance and includes hilly tracts. There is
no geographical boundary between it and the<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> north-eastern part of the
Madras Presidency or the eastern part of the Central Provinces.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chilka Lake.</span>&mdash;This marine lake is a
shallow lagoon measuring about 40 miles in length and 10 miles in
breadth, and formed in geologically recent times by the growth of a
narrow sand-bank across the mouth of a wide bay. At its northern end it
communicates with the sea by a narrow channel, and throughout its length
it is strongly affected by the tides. At its south end, which is
actually situated in the Ganjam district of Madras, the water is
distinctly brackish and is said to be nearly fresh at certain times of
year. At this end there are numerous small artificial pools of brackish
water somewhat resembling those of Port Canning as regards their
fauna.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sur</span> (or <span class="smcap">Sar</span>)
<span class="smcap">Lake</span>.&mdash;A shallow, freshwater lake of
very variable size situated a few miles north of Puri on the Orissa
coast. In origin it probably resembled the Chilka Lake, but it is now
separated from the sea by about 3 miles of barren sand dunes, among
which numerous little pools of rain-water are formed during the rains.
These dry up completely in winter, and even the lake itself is said
sometimes almost to disappear, although when it is full it is several
miles in length. The fauna is essentially a freshwater one, but includes
certain Mysidæ and other crustacea usually found in brackish water.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Bombay Presidency.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bombay.</span>&mdash;The town of Bombay, built on
an island near the mainland, is situated close to swamps and creeks of
brackish water not unlike those that surround Calcutta. Its "tanks,"
however, differ from those of Calcutta in having rocky bottoms and, in
many cases, in drying up completely in the hot weather. Of the fauna of
the swamps extremely little is known, but so far as the sponges and
polyzoa of the tanks are concerned the work undertaken by Carter was
probably exhaustive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Igatpuri.</span>&mdash;Igatpuri is situated at an
altitude of about 2000 feet, 60 miles north-east of Bombay. Above the
town there is a lake of several square miles in area whence the
water-supply of several stations in the neighbourhood is obtained. The
water is therefore kept free from contamination. The bottom is composed
of small stones and slopes gradually up at the edges. During the dry
weather its level sinks considerably. Several interesting sponges<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> and
polyzoa have been found in this lake, most of them also occurring in a
small pond in the neighbourhood in which clothes are washed and the
water is often full of soap-suds.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Southern India.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madras.</span>&mdash;The city of Madras is built
by the sea, straggling over a large area of the sandy soil
characteristic of the greater part of the east coast of India. In wet
weather this soil retains many temporary pools of rain-water, and there
are numerous permanent tanks of no great size in the neighbourhood of
the town. The so-called Cooum River, which flows through the town, is
little more than a tidal creek, resembling the Mutlah River of Lower
Bengal on a much smaller scale. The sponges and polyzoa as yet found in
the environs of Madras are identical with those found in the environs of
Calcutta.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bangalore.</span>&mdash;Bangalore (Mysore State)
is situated near the centre of the Madras Presidency on a plateau about
3000 feet above sea-level. The surrounding country is formed of laterite
rock which decomposes readily and forms a fine reddish silt in the
tanks. These tanks are numerous, often of large size, and as a rule at
least partly of artificial origin. Their water supports few phanerogamic
plants and is, as my friend Dr. Morris Travers informs me, remarkably
free from salts in solution. The sponge fauna of the neighbourhood of
Bangalore appears to be intermediate between that of Madras and that of
Travancore.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Backwaters of Cochin and
Travancore.</span>&mdash;The "backwaters" of Cochin and Travancore were
originally a series of shallow lagoons stretching along the coast of the
southern part of the west coast of India for a distance of considerably
over a hundred miles. They have now been joined together by means of
canals and tunnels to form a tidal waterway, which communicates at many
points directly with the sea. The salinity of the water differs greatly
at different places and in different seasons, and at some places there
is an arrangement to keep out sea-water while the rice-fields are being
irrigated. The fauna is mainly marine, but in the less saline parts of
the canals and lakes many freshwater species are found.</p>

<p><i>Shasthancottah.</i>&mdash;There are two villages of this name, one
situated on the backwater near Quilon (coast of Travancore), the<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> other
about three miles inland on a large freshwater lake. This lake, which
does not communicate with the backwater, occupies a narrow winding rift
several miles in length at a considerable depth below the surrounding
country. Its bottom is muddy and it contains few water-plants, although
in some places the water-plants that do exist are matted together to
form floating islands on which trees and bushes grow. The fauna, at any
rate as regards mollusca and microscopic organisms, is remarkably poor,
but two species of polyzoa (<i>Fredericella indica</i> and <i>Plumatella
fruticosa</i>) and one of sponge (<i>Trochospongilla pennsylvanica</i>)
grow in considerable abundance although not in great luxuriance.</p>

<p class="center"><i>The Himalayas.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bhim Tal</span><a name="fnanchor_H"
id="fnanchor_H"></a><a href="#footnote_H"
class="fnanchor"><sup>[H]</sup></a> is a lake situated at an altitude of
4500 feet in that part of the Western Himalayas known as Kumaon, near
the plains. It has a superficial area of several square miles, and is
deep in the middle. Its bottom and banks are for the most part muddy.
Little is known of its fauna, but two polyzoa (<i>Plumatella allmani</i>
and <i>Lophopodella carteri</i>) and the gemmules of two sponges
(<i>Spongilla carteri</i> and <i>Ephydatia meyeni</i>) have been found
in it.</p>

<p class="center">*     *     *     *     *</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Nomenclature and
Terminology.</span></p>

<p>The subject of nomenclature may be considered under four
heads:&mdash;(I.) the general terminology of the various kinds of groups
of individuals into which organisms must be divided; (II.) the general
nomenclature of specimens belonging to particular categories, such as
types, co-types, etc.; (III.) the nomenclature that depends on such
questions as that of "priority"; and (IV.) the special terminology
peculiar to the different groups. The special terminology peculiar to
the different groups is dealt with in the separate introductions to each
of the three parts of this volume.</p>

<p class="center">(I.)</p>

<p>No group of animals offers greater difficulty than the sponges,
hydroids, and polyzoa (and especially the freshwater representatives of
these three groups) as regards the question "What is a species?" and the
kindred questions, "What is a subspecies?" "What is a variety?" and
"What is a phase?" Genera can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18"
id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> often be left to look after themselves,
but the specific and kindred questions are answered in so many different
ways, if they are even considered, by different systematists, especially
as regards the groups described in this volume, that I feel it necessary
to state concisely my own answers to these questions, not for the
guidance of other zoologists but merely to render intelligible the
system of classification here adopted. The following definitions should
therefore be considered in estimating the value of "species," etc.,
referred to in the following pages.</p>

<p><i>Species.</i>&mdash;A group of individuals differing in constant
characters of a definite nature and of systematic<a name="fnanchor_I"
id="fnanchor_I"></a><a href="#footnote_I"
class="fnanchor"><sup>[I]</sup></a> importance from all others in the
same genus.</p>

<p><i>Subspecies.</i>&mdash;An isolated or local race, the individuals
of which differ from others included in the same species in characters
that are constant but either somewhat indefinite or else of little
systematic importance.</p>

<p><i>Variety.</i>&mdash;A group of individuals not isolated
geographically from others of the same species but nevertheless
exhibiting slight, not altogether constant, or indefinite differences
from the typical form of the species (<i>i. e.</i>, the form first
described).</p>

<p><i>Phase.</i>&mdash;A peculiar form assumed by the individuals of a
species which are exposed to peculiarities in environment and differ
from normal individuals as a direct result.</p>

<p>There are cases in which imperfection of information renders it
difficult or impossible to distinguish between a variety and a
subspecies. In such cases it is best to call the form a variety, for
this term does not imply any special knowledge as regards its
distribution or the conditions in which it is found.</p>

<p>I use the term "form" in a general sense of which the meaning or
meanings are clear without explanation.</p>

<p class="center">(II.)</p>

<p>The question of type specimens must be considered briefly. There are
two schools of systematists, those who assert that one specimen and one
only must be the type of a species, and those who are willing to accept
several specimens as types. From the theoretical point of view it seems
impossible to set up any one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19"
id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> individual as the ideal type of a
species, but those who possess collections or are in charge of museums
prefer, with the natural instinct of the collector, to have a definite
single type (of which no one else can possibly possess a duplicate) in
their possession or care, and there is always the difficulty that a
zoologist in describing a species, if he recognizes more than one type,
may include as types specimens that really belong to more than one
species. These difficulties are met by some zoologists by the
recognition of several specimens as paratypes, all of equal value; but
this, after all, is merely a terminological means of escaping from the
difficulty, calculated to salve the conscience of a collector who feels
unwilling to give up the unique type of a species represented by other
specimens in his collection. The difficulty as regards the confounding
of specimens of two or more species as the types of one can always be
adjusted if the author who discovers the mistake redescribes one of the
species under the original name and regards the specimen that agrees
with his description as the type, at the same time describing a new
species with another of the specimens as its type. Personally I always
desire to regard the whole material that forms the basis of an original
description of a species as the type, but museum rules often render this
impossible, and the best that can be done is to pick out one specimen
that seems particularly characteristic and to call it the type, the rest
of the material being termed co-types. A peculiar difficulty arises,
however, as regards many of the sponges, c&oelig;lenterates, and
polyzoa, owing to the fact that they are often either compound animals,
each specimen consisting of more than one individual, or are easily
divisible into equivalent fragments. If the single type theory were
driven to its logical conclusion, it would be necessary to select one
particular polyp in a hydroid colony, or even the part of a sponge that
surrounded a particular osculum as the type of the species to which the
hydroid or the sponge belonged. Either by accident or by design
specimens of Spongillidæ, especially if kept dry, are usually broken
into several pieces. There is, as a matter of fact, no reason to
attribute the peculiarly sacrosanct nature of a type to one piece more
than another. In such cases the biggest piece may be called the type,
while the smaller pieces may be designated by the term "schizotype."</p>

<p>The more precise definition of such terms as topotype, genotype,
<i>et hujus generis omnis</i> is nowadays a science (or at any rate a
form of technical industry) by itself and need not be discussed
here.</p>

<p class="center"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20"
id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>(III.)</p>

<p>In 1908 an influential committee of British zoologists drew up a
strenuous protest against the unearthing of obsolete zoological names
(see 'Nature,' Aug. 1908, p.&nbsp;395). To no group does this protest apply
with greater force than to the three discussed in this volume. It is
difficult, however, to adopt any one work as a standard of nomenclature
for the whole of any one of them. As regards the Spongillidæ it is
impossible to accept any monograph earlier than Potts's "Fresh-Water
Sponges" (P. Ac. Philad., 1887), for Bowerbank's and Carter's earlier
monographs contained descriptions of comparatively few species. Even
Potts's monograph I have been unable to follow without divergence, for
it seems to me necessary to recognize several genera and subgenera that
he ignored. The freshwater polyzoa, however, were dealt with in so
comprehensive a manner by Allman in his "Fresh-Water Polyzoa" (London,
1856) that no difficulty is experienced in ignoring, so far as
nomenclature is concerned, any earlier work on the group; while as
regards other divisions of the polyzoa I have followed Hincks's "British
Marine Polyzoa" (1880), so far as recent researches permit. In most
cases I have not attempted to work out an elaborate synonymy of species
described earlier than the publication of the works just cited, for to
do so is a mere waste of time in the case of animals that call for a
most precise definition of species and genera and yet were often
described, so far as they were known earlier than the dates in question,
in quite general terms. I have been confirmed in adopting this course by
the fact that few of the types of the earlier species are now in
existence, and that a large proportion of the Indian forms have only
been described within the last few years.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Material.</span></p>

<p>The descriptions in this volume are based on specimens in the
collection of the Indian Museum, the Trustees of which, by the liberal
manner in which they have permitted me to travel in India and Burma on
behalf of the Museum, have made it possible not only to obtain material
for study and exchange but also to observe the different species in
their natural environment. This does not mean to say that specimens from
other collections have been ignored, for many institutions and
individuals have met us generously in the matter of gifts and exchanges,
and our collection<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21"
id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> now includes specimens of all the
Indian forms, named in nearly all cases by the author of the species,
except in those of species described long ago of which no authentic
original specimens can now be traced. Pieces of the types of all of the
Indian Spongillidæ described by Carter have been obtained from the
British Museum through the kind offices of Mr. R. Kirkpatrick. The
Smithsonian Institution has sent us from the collection of the United
States National Museum specimens named by Potts, and the Berlin Museum
specimens named by Weltner, while to the Imperial Academy of Sciences of
St. Petersburg we owe many unnamed but interesting sponges. Dr. K.
Kraepelin and Dr. W. Michaelsen have presented us with specimens of most
of the species and varieties of freshwater polyzoa described by the
former in his great monograph and elsewhere. We owe to Dr. S. F. Harmer,
formerly of the Cambridge University Museum and now Keeper in Zoology at
the British Museum, to Professor Max Weber of Amsterdam, Professor Oka
of Tokyo, and several other zoologists much valuable material. I would
specially mention the exquisite preparations presented by Mr. C.
Rousselet. Several naturalists in India have also done good service to
the Museum by presenting specimens of the three groups described in this
volume, especially Major H. J. Walton, I.M.S., Major J. Stephenson,
I.M.S., Dr. J. R. Henderson and Mr. G. Matthai of Madras, and Mr. R.
Shunkara Narayana Pillay of Trivandrum.</p>

<p>The following list shows where the types of the various species,
subspecies, and varieties are preserved, so far as it has been possible
to trace them. I have included in this list the names of all species
that have been found in stagnant water, whether fresh or brackish, but
those of species not yet found in fresh water are enclosed in square
brackets.</p>

<p>The literature dealing with the various groups described in
the volume is discussed in the introductions to the three parts.
Throughout the volume I have, so far as possible, referred to works that
can be consulted in Calcutta in the libraries of the Indian Museum, the
Geological Survey of India, or the Asiatic Society of Bengal. The names
of works that are not to be found in India are marked with a *. The
rarity with which this mark occurs says much for the fortunate position
in which zoologists stationed in Calcutta find themselves as regards
zoological literature, for I do not think that anything essential has
been omitted.</p>

<p>It remains for me to express my gratitude to those who have assisted
me in the preparation of this volume. The names of<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> those
who have contributed specimens for examination have already been
mentioned. I have to thank the Trustees of the Indian Museum not only
for their liberal interpretation of my duties as an officer of the
Museum but also for the use of all the drawings and photographs and some
of the blocks from which this volume is illustrated. Several of the
latter have already been used in the "Records of the Indian Museum."
From the Editor of the "Fauna" I have received valuable suggestions, and
I am indebted to Dr. Weltner of the Berlin Museum for no less valuable
references to literature. Mr. F. H. Gravely, Assistant Superintendent in
the Indian Museum, has saved me from several errors by his
criticism.</p>

<p>The majority of the figures have been drawn by the draftsmen of the
Indian Museum, Babu Abhoya Charan Chowdhary, and of the Marine Survey of
India, Babu Shib Chandra Mondul, to both of whom I am much indebted for
their accuracy of delineation.</p>

<p>No work dealing with the sponges of India would be complete without a
tribute to the memory of H. J. Carter, pioneer in the East of the study
of lower invertebrates, whose work persists as a guide and an
encouragement to all of us who are of the opinion that biological
research on Indian animals can only be undertaken in India, and that
even systematic zoological work can be carried out in that country with
success. I can only hope that this, the first volume in the official
Fauna of the Indian Empire to be written entirely in India, may prove
not unworthy of his example.</p>

FRESHWATER SPONGES<br />
(SPONGILLIDÆ).</h3>

<h3 class="p4">INTRODUCTION TO PART I.</h3>

<p class="p2 center">I.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Phylum Porifera.</span></p>

<p>The phylum Porifera or Spongiæ includes the simplest of the Metazoa
or multicellular animals. From the compound Protozoa its members are
distinguished by the fact that the cells of which they are composed
exhibit considerable differentiation both in structure and in function,
and are associated together in a definite manner, although they are not
combined to form organs and systems of organs as in the higher Metazoa.
Digestion, for instance, is performed in the sponges entirely by
individual cells, into the substance of which the food is taken, and the
products of digestion are handed on to other cells without the
intervention of an alimentary canal or a vascular system, while there is
no structure in any way comparable to the nervous system of more highly
organized animals.</p>

<p>The simplest form of sponge, which is known as an olynthus, is a
hollow vase-like body fixed at one end to some solid object, and with an
opening called the osculum at the other. The walls are perforated by
small holes, the pores, from which the name Porifera is derived.</p>

<p>Externally the surface is protected by a delicate membrane formed of
flattened cells and pierced by the pores, while the interior of the vase
is covered with curious cells characteristic of the sponges, and known
as choanocytes or collar-cells. They consist of minute oval or
pear-shaped bodies, one end of which is provided with a rim or collar of
apparently structureless membrane, while a flagellum or whip-like lash
projects from the centre of the surface surrounded by the collar. These
collar-cells are practically identical with those of which the Protozoa
known as Choanoflagellata consist; but it is only in the sponges<a
name="fnanchor_K" id="fnanchor_K"></a><a href="#footnote_K"
class="fnanchor"><sup>[K]</sup></a> that they are found constantly
associated with other cells unlike themselves.</p>

<p>In addition to the collar-cells, which form what is called the
gastral layer, and the external membrane (the derma or dermal<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
membrane), the sponge contains cells of various kinds embedded in a
structureless gelatinous substance, through which they have the power of
free movement. Most of these cells have also the power of changing their
form in an "am&oelig;boid" manner; that is to say, by projecting and
withdrawing from their margin mobile processes of a more or less
finger-like form, but unstable in shape or direction. The protoplasm of
which some of the cells are formed is granular, while that of others is
clear and translucent. Some cells, which (for the time being at any
rate) do not exhibit am&oelig;boid movements, are glandular in function,
while others again give rise in various ways to the bodies by means of
which the sponge reproduces its kind. There is evidence, however, that
any one kind of cell, even those of the membrane and the gastral layer,
can change its function and its form in case of necessity.</p>

<p>Most sponges possess a supporting framework or skeleton. In some it
is formed entirely of a horny substance called spongin (as in the
bath-sponge), in others it consists of spicules of inorganic matter
(either calcareous or siliceous) secreted by special cells, or of such
spicules bound together by spongin. Extraneous objects, such as
sand-grains, are frequently included in the skeleton. The spongin is
secreted like the spicules by special cells, but its chemical structure
is much more complicated than that of the spicules, and it is not
secreted (at any rate in most cases) in such a way as to form bodies of
a definite shape. In the so-called horny sponges it resembles the chitin
in which insects and other arthropods are clothed.</p>

<p class="center">*     *     *     *     *</p>

<p>In no adult sponge do the collar-cells completely cover the whole of
the internal surface, the olynthus being a larval form, and by no means
a common larval form. It is only found in certain sponges with
calcareous spicules. As the structure of the sponge becomes more
complicated the collar-cells are tucked away into special pockets or
chambers known as ciliated chambers, and finally the approach to these
chambers, both from the external surface and from the inner or gastral
cavity, takes the form of narrow tubes or canals instead of mere pores.
With further complexity the simple internal cavity tends to disappear,
and the sponge proliferates in such a way that more than one osculum is
formed. In the class Demospongiæ, to which the sponges described in this
volume belong, the whole system is extremely complicated.</p>

<p>The skeleton of sponges, when it is not composed wholly of spongin,
consists of, or at any rate contains, spicules that have a definite
chemical composition and definite shapes in accordance with the class,
order, family, genus, and species of the sponge. Formerly sponges were
separated into calcareous, siliceous, and horny sponges by the nature of
their skeleton; and although the system of classification now adopted
has developed into a much more complex one and a few sponges are known
that have both calcareous and siliceous spicules, the question whether
the spicules<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg
29]</a></span> are formed of salts of lime or of silica (strictly
speaking of opal) is very important. All Demospongiæ that have spicules
at all have them of the latter substance, and the grade Monaxonida, in
which the freshwater sponges constitute the family Spongillidæ, is
characterized by the possession of spicules that have typically the form
of a needle pointed at both ends. Although spicules of this simple form
may be absent in species that belong to the grade, the larger spicules,
which are called megascleres, have not normally more than one main axis
and are always more or less rod-like in outline. They are usually
arranged so as to form a reticulate skeleton. Frequently, however, the
megascleres or skeleton-spicules are not the only spicules present, for
we find smaller spicules (microscleres) of one or more kinds lying loose
in the substance of the sponge and in the external membrane, or, in the
Spongillidæ only, forming a special armature for the reproductive bodies
known as gemmules.</p>

<p>All sponges obtain their food in the same way, namely by means of the
currents of water set up by the flagella of the collar-cells. These
flagella, although apparently there is little concerted action among
them, cause by their rapid movements changes of pressure in the water
contained in the cavities of the sponge. The water from outside
therefore flows in at the pores and finally makes its way out of the
oscula. With the water minute particles of organic matter are brought
into the sponge, the collar-cells of which, and probably other cells,
have the power of selecting and engulfing suitable particles. Inside the
cells these particles undergo certain chemical changes, and are at least
partially digested. The resulting substances are then handed on directly
to other cells, or, as some assert, are discharged into the common
jelly, whence they are taken up by other cells.</p>

<p>Sponges reproduce their kind in more ways than one, <i>viz.</i>, by
means of eggs (which are fertilized as in other animals by spermatozoa),
by means of buds, and by means of the peculiar bodies called gemmules
the structure and origin of which is discussed below (p.&nbsp;42). They are
of great importance in the classification of the Spongillidæ. Sponges
can also be propagated artificially by means of fission, and it is
probable that this method of reproduction occurs accidentally, if not
normally, in natural circumstances.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">General Structure of the
Spongillidæ.</span></p>

<p>It would be impracticable in this introduction to give a full account
of the structure of the Spongillidæ, which in some respects is still
imperfectly known. Students who desire further information should
consult Professor Minchin's account of the sponges in Lankester's
'Treatise on Zoology,' part ii, or, if a less technical description is
desired, Miss Sollas's contribution to the 'Cambridge Natural History,'
vol. i, in which special attention is paid to <i>Spongilla</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg

a vertical section through a living freshwater sponge. Although it
represents the structure of the organism as being very much simpler than
is actually the case, and entirely omits the skeleton, it will be found
useful as indicating the main features of the anatomy.</p>

<p>It will be noted that the diagram represents an individual with a
single osculum or exhalent aperture. As a rule adult Demospongiæ have
several or many oscula, but even in the Spongillidæ sponges occur in
which there is only one. New oscula are formed by a kind of
proliferation that renders the structure still more complex than it is
when only one exhalent aperture is present.</p>

<p>The little arrows in the figure indicate the direction of the
currents of water that pass through the sponge. It enters through small
holes in the derma into a subdermal cavity, which separates the membrane
from the bulk of the sponge. This space differs greatly in extent in
different species. From the subdermal space the water is forced by the
action of the flagella into narrow tubular canals that carry it into the
ciliated chambers. Thence it passes into other canals, which communicate
with what remains of the central cavity, and so out of the oscula.</p>

<p>The ciliated chambers are very minute, and the collar-cells
excessively so. It is very difficult to examine them owing to their
small size and delicate structure. Fig. 2 D represents a collar-cell of
a sponge seen under a very high power of the microscope in ideal
conditions.</p>

<p>The nature of the inhalent apertures in the external membrane has
been much discussed as regards the Demospongiæ, but the truth seems to
be that their structure differs considerably even in <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
closely allied species. At any rate this is the case as regards the
Indian <i>Spongillæ</i>. In all species the membrane is composed of
flattened cells of irregular shape fitted together like the pieces of a
puzzle-picture. In some species (e.&nbsp;g., <i>Spongilla carteri</i>)
the apertures in the membrane consist merely of spaces between adjacent
cells, which may be a little more crowded together than is usual. But in
others (e.&nbsp;g., <i>Spongilla proliferens</i> and <i>Spongilla
crassissima</i>) in which the pores are extremely small, each pore
normally pierces the middle of a flat, ring-shaped cell or porocyte.
Occasionally, however, a pore may be found that is enclosed by two
narrow, crescent-shaped cells joined together at their tips to form a
ring. The porocytes of sponges like <i>Spongilla carteri</i> are
probably not actually missing, but instead of being in the external
membrane are situated below the derma at the external entrance to the
canals that carry water to the flagellated chambers or even at the
entrance to the chambers themselves<a name="fnanchor_L"
id="fnanchor_L"></a><a href="#footnote_L"
class="fnanchor"><sup>[L]</sup></a>. Some authors object on theoretical
grounds to the statement that porocytes exist in the Demospongia, and it
is possible that these cells have in this grade neither the same origin
as, nor a precisely similar function to, the porocytes of other sponges.
When they occur in the dermal membrane no great difficulty is
experienced in seeing them under a sufficiently high power of the
microscope, if the material is well preserved and mounted and stained in
a suitable manner<a name="fnanchor_M" id="fnanchor_M"></a><a
href="#footnote_M" class="fnanchor"><sup>[M]</sup></a>. In most sponges
the porocytes can contract in such a way that the aperture in their
centre is practically closed, but this power appears to be possessed by
the porocytes of <i>Spongilla</i> only to a very limited extent,
although they closely resemble the porocytes of other sponges in
appearance.</p>

<p>The external membrane in many Spongillidæ is prolonged round and
above the oscula so as to form an oscular collar. This structure is
highly contractile, but cannot close together. As a rule it is much more
conspicuous in living sponges than in preserved specimens.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to deal here with most of the cells that occur in
the parenchyma or gelatinous part of the sponge. A full list of the
kinds that are found is given by Dr. Weltner in his
"Spongillidenstudien, V," p.&nbsp;276 (Arch. Naturg. Berlin, lxxiii (i),
1907). One kind must, however, be briefly noticed as being of some
systematic importance, namely the "bubble-cells" (fig. 2 A) that are
characteristic of some species of <i>Ephydatia</i> and other genera.
These cells are comparatively large, spherical in form; each of them
contains a globule of liquid which not only occupies the greater part of
the cell, but forces the protoplasm to assume the form of a delicate
film lining the cell-wall and covering the<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> globule. In optical
section "bubble-cells" have a certain resemblance to porocytes, but the
cell is of course imperforate and not flattened.</p>

<p>In the Spongillidæ the spicules and the skeleton are more important
as regards the recognition of genera and species than<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> the
soft parts. The skeleton is usually reticulate, but sometimes consists
of a mass of spicules almost without arrangement. The amount of spongin
present is also different in different species. The spicules in a
reticulate skeleton are arranged so as to form fibres of two
kinds&mdash;radiating fibres, which radiate outwards from the centre of
the sponge and frequently penetrate the external membrane, and
transverse fibres, which run across from one radiating fibre to another.
The fibres are composed of relatively large spicules (megascleres)
arranged parallel to one another, overlapping at the ends, and bound
together by means of a more or less profuse secretion of spongin. In
some species they are actually enclosed in a sheath of this substance.
The radiating fibres are usually more distinct and stouter than the
transverse ones, which are often represented by single spicules but are
sometimes splayed out at the ends so as to assume in outline the form of
an hour-glass (fig. 3 B). The radiating fibres frequently raise up the
membrane at their free extremities just as a tent-pole does a tent.</p>

<p>Normal spicules of the skeleton are always rod-like or needle-like,
and either blunt or pointed at both ends; they are either
smooth, granular, or covered with small spines. Sometimes
spicules of the same type form a more or less irregular transverse
network at the base or on the surface of the sponge.</p>

</div>

<p>From the systematist's point of view, the structure of the free
spicules found scattered in the substance and membrane of the sponge,
and especially of those that form the armature of the gemmules, is of
more importance than that of the skeleton-spicules. Free spicules are
absent in many species; when present they are usually needle-like and
pointed at the tips. In a few species, however, they are of variable or
irregular form, or consist of several or many shafts meeting in a common
central nodule. In one genus (<i>Corvospongilla</i>) they resemble a
double grappling-iron in form, having a circle of strongly recurved
hooks at both ends. The free microscleres, or flesh-spicules as they are
often called, are either smooth, granular, or spiny.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg
35]</a></span> Gemmule-spicules, which form a characteristic feature of
the Spongillidæ, are very seldom absent when the gemmules are mature.
They are of the greatest importance in distinguishing the genera. In
their simplest form they closely resemble the free microscleres, but in
several genera they bear, either at or near one end or at or near both
ends, transverse disks which are either smooth or indented round the
edge. In one genus (<i>Pectispongilla</i>) they are provided at both
ends not with disks but with vertically parallel rows of spines
resembling combs in appearance.</p>

<p>The simpler spicules of the Spongillidæ are formed in single cells
(see fig. 2 E), but those of more complicated shape are produced by
several cells acting in concert. Each spicule, although it is formed
mainly of hydrated silica (opal), contains a slender organic filament
running along its main axis inside the silica. This filament, or rather
the tube in which it is contained, is often quite conspicuous, and in
some species (e.&nbsp;g., <i>Spongilla crassissima</i>) its termination
is marked at both ends of the megasclere by a minute conical
protuberance in the silica.</p>

<p>Unless sponges are alchemists and can transmute one element into
another, the material of which the spicules are made must ultimately
come from the water in which the sponges live, or the rocks or other
bodies to or near which they are attached. The amount of water that must
pass through a large specimen of such a sponge as <i>Spongilla
carteri</i> in order that it may obtain materials for its skeleton must
be enormous, for silica is an insoluble substance. I have noticed,
however, that this sponge is particularly abundant and grows with
special luxuriance in ponds in which clothes are washed with soap, and
my friend Mr. G. H. Tipper has suggested to me that possibly the alkali
contained in the soap-suds may assist the sponge in dissolving out the
silica contained in the mud at the bottom of the ponds. The question of
how the mineral matter of the skeleton is obtained is, however, one
about which we know nothing definite.</p>

<p>The spongin that binds the skeleton-spicules together takes the form
of a colourless or yellowish transparent membrane, which is often
practically invisible. When very abundant it sometimes extends across
the nodes of the skeleton as a delicate veil. In some sponges it also
forms a basal membrane in contact with the object to which the sponge is
attached, and in some such cases the spongin of the radiating fibres is
in direct continuity with that of the basal membrane.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Colour and Odour.</span></p>

<p>Most freshwater sponges have a bad odour, which is more marked in
some species than in others. This odour is not peculiar to the
Spongillidæ, for it is practically identical with that given out by the
common marine sponge <i>Halichondria panicea</i>.<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> Its
function is probably protective, but how it is produced we do not
know.</p>

<p>The coloration of freshwater sponges is usually dull and uniform, but
<i>Pectispongilla aurea</i> is of the brilliant yellow indicated by its
name, while many species are of the bright green shade characteristic of
chlorophyll, the colouring matter of the leaves of plants. Many species
are brown or grey, and some are almost white.</p>

<p>These colours are due to one of three causes, or to a combination of
more than one of them, viz.:&mdash;(1) the inhalation of solid inorganic
particles, which are engulfed by the cells; (2) the presence in the
cells of coloured substances, solid or liquid, produced by the vital
activities of the sponge; and (3) the presence in the cells of peculiar
organized living bodies known as "green corpuscles."</p>

<p>Sponges living in muddy water are often nearly black. This is because
the cells of their parenchyma are gorged with very minute solid
particles of silt. If a sponge of the kind is kept in clean water for a
few days, it often becomes almost white. An interesting experiment is
easily performed to illustrate the absorption and final elimination of
solid colouring matter by placing a living sponge (small specimens of
<i>Spongilla carteri</i> are suitable) in a glass of clean water, and
sprinkling finely powdered carmine in the water. In a few hours the
sponge will be of a bright pink colour, but if only a little carmine is
used at first and no more added, it will regain its normal greyish hue
in a few days.</p>

<p>The colouring matter produced by the sponge itself is of two
kinds&mdash;pigment, which is probably a waste product, and the
substances produced directly by the ingestion of food or in the process
of its digestion. When pigment is produced it takes the form of minute
granules lying in the cells of the parenchyma, the dermal membrane being
as a rule colourless. Very little is known about the pigments of
freshwater sponges, and even less about the direct products of
metabolism. It is apparently the latter, however, that give many
otherwise colourless sponges a slight pinkish or yellowish tinge
directly due to the presence in cells of the parenchyma of minute liquid
globules. In one form of <i>Spongilla carteri</i> these globules turn of
a dark brown colour if treated with alcohol. The brilliant colour of
<i>Pectispongilla aurea</i> is due not to solid granules but to a liquid
or semi-liquid substance contained in the cells.</p>

<p>The green corpuscles of the Spongillidæ are not present in all
species. There is every reason to think that they represent a stage in
the life-history of an alga, and that they enter the sponge in an active
condition (see p.&nbsp;49).</p>

<p>A fourth cause for the coloration of freshwater sponges may be noted
briefly. It is not a normal one, but occurs commonly in certain forms
(e.&nbsp;g., <i>Spongilla alba</i> var. <i>bengalensis</i>). This cause
is the growth in the canals and substance of the sponge of
parasitic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg
37]</a></span> algaæ, which turn the whole organism of a dull green
colour. They do not do so, however, until they have reduced it to a
dying state. The commonest parasite of the kind is a filamentous species
particularly common in brackish water in the Ganges delta.</p>

</div>

<p>The external form of sponges is very variable, but each species,
subspecies, or variety of the Spongillidæ has normally a characteristic
appearance. The European race of <i>Spongilla lacustris</i>, for
example, consists in favourable circumstances of a flattened basal part
from which long cylindrical branches grow out; while in the Indian race
of the species these branches are flattened instead of being
cylindrical, and anastomose freely. The structure of the branches is
identical with that of the basal part. Many other species (for instance,
<i>Spongilla bombayensis</i> and <i>S. ultima</i>) never produce
branches but always consist of lichenoid<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> or cushion-shaped masses.
The appearance of <i>Spongilla crateriformis</i>, when it is growing on
a flattened surface which allows it to develop its natural form, is very
characteristic, for it consists of little flattened masses that seem to
be running out towards one another, just as though the sponge had been
dropped, spoonful by spoonful, in a viscous condition from a teaspoon.
Some species, such as <i>Trochospongilla phillottiana</i>, cover large
areas with a thin film of uniform thickness, while others (e.&nbsp;g.,
<i>Spongilla alba</i> and <i>Ephydatia meyeni</i>) consist of irregular
masses, the surface of which bears numerous irregular ridges or conical,
subquadrate, or digitate processes. In a few forms (e.&nbsp;g.,
<i>Corvospongilla burmanica</i>) the surface is covered with small
turret-like projections of considerable regularity, and some
(e.&nbsp;g., <i>Spongilla crassissima</i>) naturally assume a spherical
or oval shape with an absolutely smooth surface.</p>

<p>The production of long branches is apparently rare in tropical
freshwater sponges.</p>

<p>The form of the oscula is characteristic in many cases. No other
Indian species has them so large, or with such well-defined margins as
<i>Spongilla carteri</i> (Pl. II, fig. 1). In many species (Pl. II, fig.
3) they have a stellate appearance owing to the fact that grooves in the
substance of the sponge radiate round them beneath the external
membrane. In other species they are quite inconspicuous and very small.</p>

<p>Spongillidæ differ greatly in consistency. <i>Spongilla
crassissima</i> and <i>Corvospongilla lapidosa</i> are almost stony,
although the former is extremely light, more like pumice than true
stone. Other species (e.&nbsp;g., <i>Trochospongilla latouchiana</i>)
are hard but brittle, while others again are soft and easily compressed,
as <i>Spongilla lacustris</i>, the variety <i>mollis</i> of <i>S.
carteri</i>, and <i>S. crateriformis</i>. The consistency of a sponge
depends on two factors&mdash;the number of spicules present, and the
amount of spongin. In <i>Corvospongilla lapidosa</i> the number of
spicules is very large indeed. They are not arranged so as to form a
reticulate skeleton but interlock in<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> all directions, and there
is hardly any spongin associated with them. In <i>Spongilla
crassissima</i>, on the other hand, the number of spicules although
large is not unusually so; but they form a very definitely reticulate
skeleton, and are bound together by an unusually profuse secretion of
spongin. In <i>S. carteri</i> var. <i>mollis</i> both spicules and
spongin are reduced to a minimum, and the parenchyma is relatively more
bulky than usual.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Variation.</span></p>

<p>Sponges are very variable organisms, and even a slight change in the
environment of the freshwater species often produces a considerable
change in form and structure. Some species vary in accordance with the
season, and others without apparent cause. Not only have many given rise
to subspecies and "varieties" that possess a certain stability, but most
if not all are liable to smaller changes that apparently affect both the
individual and the breed, at any rate for a period.</p>

<p class="center">(a) <i>Seasonal Variation.</i></p>

<p>Weltner has shown in a recent paper (Arch. Natg. Berlin, lxxiii (i),
p.&nbsp;276, 1907) that in Europe those individuals of <i>Ephydatia</i> which
are found (exceptionally) in an active condition in winter differ
considerably both as regards the number of their cells and their anatomy
from those found in summer. In Calcutta the majority of the individuals
of <i>Spongilla carteri</i> that are found in summer have their external
surface unusually smooth and rounded, and contain in their parenchyma
numerous cells the protoplasm of which is gorged with liquid. These
cells give the whole sponge a faint pinkish tinge during life; but if it
is plunged in spirit, both the liquid in the cells and the spirit turn
rapidly of a dark brown colour. Specimens of <i>Spongilla
crateriformis</i> taken in a certain tank in Calcutta during the cold
weather had the majority of the skeleton-spicules blunt, while the
extremities of the gemmule-spicules were distinctly differentiated.
Specimens of the same species taken from the same tank in July had the
skeleton-spicules pointed, while the extremities of the gemmule-spicules
were much less clearly differentiated. I have been unable to confirm
this by observations made on sponges from other tanks, but it would
certainly suggest that at any rate the breed of sponges in the tank
first investigated was liable to seasonal variation.</p>

<p class="center">(b) <i>Variation due directly to Environment.</i></p>

<p>The characteristic external form of freshwater sponges is liable in
most cases to be altered as a direct result of changes in the<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
environment. The following are two characteristic instances of this
phenomenon.</p>

<p>Certain shrubs with slender stems grow in the water at the edge of
Igatpuri Lake. The stems of these shrubs support many large examples of
<i>Spongilla carteri</i>, which are kept in almost constant motion owing
to the action of the wind on those parts of the shrubs that are not
under water. The surface of the sponges is so affected by the currents
of water thus set up against it that it is covered with deep grooves and
high irregular ridges like cockscombs. Less than a hundred yards from
the lake there is a small pond in which <i>Spongilla carteri</i> is also
abundant. Here it grows on stones at the bottom and has the
characteristic and almost smooth form of the species.</p>

<p>My second instance also refers in part to Igatpuri Lake.
<i>Corvospongilla lapidosa</i> is common in the lake on the lower
surface of stones, and also occurs at Nasik, about thirty miles away, on
the walls of a conduit of dirty water. In the latter situation it has
the form of large sheets of a blackish colour, with the surface
corrugated and the oscula inconspicuous, while in the clear waters of
the lake it is of a pale yellowish colour, occurs in small lichenoid
patches, and has its oscula rendered conspicuous, in spite of their
minute size, by being raised on little conical eminences in such a way
that they resemble the craters of volcanoes in miniature.</p>

<p>Both the European and the Indian races of <i>Spongilla lacustris</i>
fail to develop branches if growing in unfavourable conditions. In
specimens obtained from the River Spree near Berlin these structures are
sometimes many inches in length; while in mature specimens taken under
stones in Loch Baa in the Island of Mull the whole organism consisted of
a minute cushion-shaped mass less than an inch in diameter, and was also
deficient in spicules. Both these breeds belong to the same species, and
probably differ as a direct result of differences in environment.</p>

<p class="center">(c) <i>Variation without apparent cause.</i></p>

<p><a href="#Plate_I">Plate I</a> in this volume illustrates an
excellent example of variation in external form to which it is
impossible to assign a cause with any degree of confidence. The three
specimens figured were all taken in the same pond, and at the same
season, but in different years. It is possible that the change in form,
which was not peculiar to a few individuals but to all those in several
adjacent ponds, was due to a difference in the salinity of the water
brought about by a more or less abundant rainfall; but of this I have
been able to obtain no evidence in succeeding years.</p>

<p>Many Spongillidæ vary without apparent cause as regards the shape,
size, and proportions of their spicules. This is the case as regards
most species of <i>Euspongilla</i> and <i>Ephydatia</i>, and is a fact
to which careful consideration has to be given in separating the
species.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Nutrition.<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></span>
</p>

<p>Very little is known about the natural food of freshwater sponges,
except that it must be of an organic nature and must be either in a very
finely divided or in a liquid condition. The cells of the sponge seem to
have the power of selecting suitable food from the water that flows past
them, and it is known that they will absorb milk. The fact that they
engulf minute particles of silt does not prove that they lack the power
of selection, for extraneous matter is taken up by them not only as food
but in order that it may be eliminated. Silt would soon block up the
canals and so put a stop to the vital activity of the sponge, if it were
not got rid of, and presumably it is only taken into the cells in order
that they may pass it on and finally disgorge it in such a way or in
such a position that it may be carried out of the oscula. The siliceous
part of it may be used in forming spicules.</p>

<p>It is generally believed that the green corpuscles play an important
part in the nutrition of those sponges in which they occur, and there
can be no doubt that these bodies have the power peculiar to all
organisms that produce chlorophyll of obtaining nutritive substances
direct from water and carbonic oxide through the action of sunlight.
Possibly they hand on some of the nourishment thus obtained to the
sponges in which they live, or benefit them by the free oxygen given out
in the process, but many Spongillidæ do well without them, even when
living in identical conditions with species in which they abound.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Reproduction.</span></p>

<p>Both eggs and buds are produced by freshwater sponges (the latter
rarely except by one species), while their gemmules attain an
elaboration of structure not observed in any other family of
sponges.</p>

<p>Probably all Spongillidæ are potentially mon&oelig;cious, that is to
say, able to produce both eggs and spermatozoa. In one Indian species,
however, in which budding is unusually common (viz. <i>Spongilla
proliferens</i>), sexual reproduction takes place very seldom, if ever.
It is not known whether the eggs of sponges are fertilized by
spermatozoa from the individual that produces the egg or by those of
other individuals, but not improbably both methods of fertilization
occur.</p>

<p>The egg of a freshwater sponge does not differ materially from that
of other animals. When mature it is a relatively large spherical cell
containing abundant food-material and situated in some natural cavity of
the sponge. In the earlier stages of its growth, however, it exhibits
am&oelig;boid movements, and makes its way through the common jelly. As
it approaches maturity it is surrounded by other cells which contain
granules of food-material. The food-material is apparently transferred
by them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg
42]</a></span> in a slightly altered form to the egg. The egg has no
shell, but in some species (e.&nbsp;g. <i>Ephydatia blembingia</i><a
name="fnanchor_N" id="fnanchor_N"></a><a href="#footnote_N"
class="fnanchor"><sup>[N]</sup></a>) it is surrounded, after
fertilization, by gland-cells belonging to the parent sponge, which
secrete round it a membrane of spongin. Development goes on within the
chamber thus formed until the larva is ready to assume a free life.</p>

<p>The spermatozoon is also like that of other animals, consisting of a
rounded head and a lash-like tail, the movements of which enable it to
move rapidly through the water. Spermatozoa are produced in
<i>Spongilla</i> from spherical cells not unlike the eggs in general
appearance. The contents of these cells divide and subdivide in such a
way that they finally consist of a mass of spermatozoa surrounded by a
single covering cell, which they finally rupture, and so escape.</p>

C=external chitinous layer; D=pneumatic coat; E=gemmule-spicule;
F=external membrane; G=foraminal tubule.</p>

<p>Gemmules are asexual reproductive bodies peculiar to the sponges, but
not to the Spongillidæ. They resemble the statoblasts of the
phylactolæmatous polyzoa in general structure as well as in function,
which is mainly that of preserving the race from destruction by such
agencies as drought, starvation, and temperatures that are either too
high or too low for its activities. This function they are enabled to
perform by the facts that they are provided with coverings not only very
hard but also fitted to resist the unfavourable agencies to which the
gemmules are likely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43"
id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> to be exposed, and that they contain
abundant food-material of which use can be made as soon as favourable
conditions occur again.</p>

<p>Internally the gemmule consists of a mass of cells containing
food-material in what may be called a tabloid form, for it consists of
minutely granular plate-like bodies. These cells are enclosed in a
flask-like receptacle, the walls of which consist of two chitinous
layers, a delicate inner membrane and an outer one of considerable
stoutness. The mouth of the flask is closed by an extension of the inner
membrane, and in some species is surrounded by a tubular extension of
the external membrane known as the foraminal tubule. Externally the
gemmule is usually covered by what is called a "pneumatic coat," also of
"chitin" (spongin), but usually of great relative thickness and
honeycombed by spaces which contain air, rendering the structure
buoyant. The pneumatic coat also contains the microscleres
characteristic of the species; it is often limited externally by a third
chitinous membrane, on which more gemmule-spicules sometimes lie
parallel to the surface.</p>

<p>The cells from which those of the gemmules are derived are akin in
origin to those that give rise to eggs and spermatozoa. Some zoologists
are therefore of the opinion that the development of the gemmule is an
instance of parthenogenesis&mdash;that is to say of an organism arising
from an egg that has not been fertilized. But some of the collar-cells,
although most of them originate from the external ciliated cells of the
larva, have a similar origin. The building-up of the gemmule affords an
excellent instance of the active co-operation that exists between the
cells of sponges, and of their mobility, for the food-material that has
to be stored up is brought by cells from all parts of the sponge, and
these cells retire after discharging their load into those of the young
gemmule.</p>

<p>The formation of the gemmule of <i>Ephydatia blembingia</i>, a
Malayan species not yet found in India, is described in detail by Dr. R.
Evans (Q. J. Microsc. Sci. London, xliv, p.&nbsp;81, 1901).</p>

<p>Gemmules are produced by the freshwater sponges of Europe, N. America
and Japan at the approach of winter, but in the tropical parts of India
they are formed more frequently at the approach of the hot weather (p.
4). After they are fully formed the sponge that has produced them dies,
and as a rule disintegrates more or less completely. In some species,
however, the greater part of the skeleton remains intact, if it is not
disturbed, and retains some of the gemmules in its meshwork, where they
finally germinate. Other gemmules are set free. Some of them float on
the surface of the water; others sink to the bottom. In any case all of
them undergo a period of quiescence before germinating. It has been
found that they can be kept dry for two years without dying.</p>

<p>The function of the special spicules with which the gemmules<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> of the
Spongillidæ are provided appears to be not only to protect them but more
especially to weight them to the extent suitable to the habits of each
species. Species that inhabit running water, for example, in some cases
have heavier gemmule-spicules than those that live in stagnant water,
and their gemmules are the less easily carried away by the currents of
the river. The gemmules of sponges growing in lakes are sometimes
deficient in spicules. This is the case as regards the form of
<i>Spongilla lacustris</i> found in Lake Baa, Isle of Mull, as regards
<i>S. helvetica</i> from the Lake of Geneva, <i>S. moorei</i> from Lake
Tanganyika, and <i>S. coggini</i> from Tali-Fu in Yunnan; also as
regards the species of <i>Spongilla</i> and <i>Ephydatia</i> found in
Lake Baikal, many of the sponges of which are said never to produce
gemmules.</p>

<p>Except in the genus <i>Corvospongilla</i> and the subgenus
<i>Stratospongilla</i>, in both of which the air-spaces of the gemmules
are usually no more than cavities between different chitinous membranes,
the pneumatic coat is either "granular" or "cellular." Neither of these
terms, however, must be understood in a physiological sense, for what
appear to be granules in a granular coat are actually minute bubbles of
air contained in little cavities in a foam-like mass of chitin (or
rather spongin), while the cells in a cellular one are only larger and
more regular air-spaces with thin polygonal walls and flat horizontal
partitions. The walls of these spaces are said in some cases to contain
a considerable amount of silica.</p>

<p>The gemmules with their various coverings are usually spherical in
shape, but in some species they are oval or depressed in outline. They
lie as a rule free in the substance of the sponge, but in some species
adhere at its base to the object to which it is attached. In some
species they are joined together in groups, but in most they are quite
free one from another.</p>

<p>Reproductive buds<a name="fnanchor_O" id="fnanchor_O"></a><a
href="#footnote_O" class="fnanchor"><sup>[O]</sup></a> are produced, so
far as is known, by very few Spongillidæ, although they are common
enough in some other groups of sponges. In the only freshwater species
in which they have been found to form a habitual means of reproduction,
namely in <i>Spongilla proliferens</i>, they have much the appearance of
abortive branches, and it is possible that they have been overlooked for
this reason in other species, for they were noticed by Laurent in
<i>Spongilla lacustris</i> as long ago as 1840 (CR. Sé. Acad. Sci.
Paris, xi, p.&nbsp;478). The buds noticed by Laurent, however, were only
produced by very young sponges, and were of a different nature from
those of <i>S. proliferens</i>, perhaps representing a form of fission
rather than true budding (see 'Voyage de la Bonite: Zoophytologie,'
Spongiaires, pl. i (Paris, 1844)).</p>

<p>In <i>Spongilla proliferens</i>, a common Indian species, the buds
arise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg
45]</a></span> as thickenings of the strands of cells accompanying the
radiating spicule-fibres of the skeleton, which project outwards from
the surface of the sponge. The thickenings originate beneath the surface
and contain, at the earliest stage at which I have as yet examined them,
all the elements of the adult organism (<i>i. e.</i> flesh-spicules,
ciliated chambers, efferent and afferent canals, parenchyma-cells of
various sorts) except skeleton fibres, gemmules, and a dermal membrane.
A section at this period closely resembles one of an adult sponge,
except that the structure is more compact, the parenchyma being
relatively bulky and the canals of small diameter.</p>

<p>Laurent observed reproduction by splitting in young individuals of
<i>Spongilla</i>, but I have not been able to obtain evidence myself
that this method of reproduction occurs normally in Indian species. In
injured specimens of <i>Spongilla carteri</i>, however, I have observed
a phenomenon that seems to be rather an abnormal form of budding, little
rounded masses of cells making their way to the ends of the radiating
skeleton fibres and becoming transformed into young sponges, which break
loose and so start an independent existence. Possibly the buds observed
by Laurent in <i>S. lacustris</i> were of a similar nature.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Development.</span></p>

<p class="center">(a) <i>From the Egg.</i></p>

<p>After fertilization, the egg, lying in its cavity in the sponge,
undergoes a complete segmentation; that is to say, becomes divided into
a number of cells without any residuum remaining. The segmentation,
however, is not equal, for it results in the formation of cells of two
distinct types, one larger and less numerous than the other. As the
process continues a pear-shaped body is produced, solid at the broader
end, which consists of the larger cells, but hollow at the other.
Further changes result in the whole of the external surface becoming
ciliated or covered with fine protoplasmic lashes, each of which arises
from a single small cell; considerable differentiation now takes place
among the cells, and spicules begin to appear. At this stage or earlier
(for there seem to be differences in different species and individuals
as to the stage at which the young sponge escapes) the larva makes its
way out of the parent sponge. After a brief period of free life, in
which it swims rapidly through the water by means of its cilia, it fixes
itself by the broad end to some solid object (from which it can never
move again) and undergoes a final metamorphosis. During this process the
ciliated cells of the external layer make their way, either by a
folding-in of the whole layer or in groups of cells, into the interior,
there change into collar-cells and arrange themselves in special
cavities&mdash;the ciliated chambers of the adult. Finally an osculum,
pores, &amp;c., are formed, and the sponge is complete.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg
46]</a></span>This, of course, is the merest outline of what occurs;
other changes that take place during the metamorphosis are of great
theoretical interest, but cannot be discussed here. The student may
refer to Dr. R. Evans's account of the larval development of
<i>Spongilla lacustris</i> in the Q. J. Microsc. Sci. London, xlii, p.
363 (1899).</p>

<p class="center">(b) <i>From the Gemmule.</i></p>

<p>The period for which the gemmule lies dormant probably depends to
some extent upon environment and to some extent on the species to which
it belongs. Carter found that if he cleaned gemmules with a handkerchief
and placed them in water exposed to sunlight, they germinated in a few
days; but in Calcutta gemmules of <i>Spongilla alba</i> var.
<i>bengalensis</i> treated in this way and placed in my aquarium at the
beginning of the hot weather, did not germinate until well on in the
"rains." Even then, after about five months, only a few of them did so.
Zykoff found that in Europe gemmules kept for two years were still alive
and able to germinate.</p>

<p>Germination consists in the cellular contents of the gemmule bursting
the membrane or membranes in which they are enclosed, and making their
way out of the gemmule in the form of a delicate whitish mass, which
sometimes issues through the natural aperture in the outer chitinous
coat and sometimes through an actual rent in this coat. In the latter
case the development of the young sponge is more advanced than in the
former.</p>

<p>The fullest account of development from the gemmule as yet published
is by Zykoff, and refers to <i>Ephydatia</i> in Europe (Biol. Centralbl.
Berlin, xii, p.&nbsp;713, 1892).</p>

<p>His investigations show that the bursting of the gemmule is not
merely a mechanical effect of moisture or any such agency but is due to
development of the cellular contents, which at the time they escape have
at least undergone differentiation into two layers. Of the more
important soft structures in the sponge the osculum is the first to
appear, the ciliated chambers being formed later. This is the opposite
of what occurs in the case of the bud, but in both cases the aperture
appears to be produced by the pressure of water in the organism. The
manner and order in which the different kinds of cells originate in the
sponge derived from a gemmule give support to the view that the
primitive cell-layers on which morphologists lay great stress are not of
any great importance so far as sponges are concerned.</p>

<p class="center">(c) <i>Development of the Bud.</i></p>

<p>As the bud of <i>Spongilla proliferens</i> grows it makes its way up
the skeleton-fibre to which it was originally attached, pushing the
dermal membrane, which expands with its growth, before it. The<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
skeleton-fibre does not, however, continue to grow in the bud, in which
a number of finer fibres make their appearance, radiating from a point
approximately at the centre of the mass. As the bud projects more and
more from the surface of the sponge the dermal membrane contracts at its
base, so as finally to separate it from its parent. Further details are
given on p.&nbsp;74.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Habitat.</span></p>

<p>Mr. Edward Potts<a name="fnanchor_P" id="fnanchor_P"></a><a
href="#footnote_P" class="fnanchor"><sup>[P]</sup></a>, writing on the
freshwater sponges of North America, says:&mdash;"These organisms have
occasionally been discovered growing in water unfit for domestic uses;
but as a rule they prefer pure water, and in my experience the finest
specimens have always been found where they are subjected to the most
rapid currents." True as this is of the Spongillidæ of temperate
climates, it is hardly applicable to those of tropical India, for in
this country we find many species growing most luxuriantly and commonly
in water that would certainly be considered unfit for domestic purposes
in a country in which sanitation was treated as a science. Some species,
indeed, are only found in ponds of water polluted by human agency, and
such ponds, provided that other conditions are favourable, are perhaps
the best collecting grounds. Other favourable conditions consist in a
due mixture of light and shade, a lack of disturbance such as that
caused by cleaning out the pond, and above all in the presence of
objects suitable for the support of sponges.</p>

<p>I do not know exactly why light and shade must be mixed in a habitat
favourable for the growth of sponges, for most species prefer shade, if
it be not too dense; but it is certainly the case that, with a few
exceptions, Indian Spongillidæ flourish best in water shaded at the
edges by trees and exposed to sunlight elsewhere. One of the exceptions
to this rule is the Indian race of <i>Spongilla lucustris</i>, which is
found in small pools of water in sand-dunes without a particle of shade.
Several species are only found on the lower surface of stones and roots
in circumstances which do not suggest that their position merely
protects them from mud, which, as Mr. Potts points out, is their "great
enemy." A notable instance is <i>Trochospongilla pennsylvanica</i>,
which is found hiding away from light in America and Europe as well as
in India.</p>

<p>It is curious that it should be easy to exterminate the sponges in a
pond by cleaning it out, for one would have thought that sufficient
gemmules would have remained at the edge, or would have been brought
rapidly from elsewhere, to restock the water. Mr. Green has, however,
noted that <i>Spongilla carteri</i> has disappeared for some years from
a small lake at Peradeniya in which it was formerly abundant, owing to
the lake having been cleaned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48"
id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> out, and I have made similar
observations on several occasions in Calcutta.</p>

<p>The question of the objects to which sponges attach themselves is one
intimately connected with that of the injury done them by mud. The delta
of the Ganges is one of the muddiest districts on earth. There are no
stones or rocks in the rivers and ponds, but mud everywhere. If a sponge
settles in the mud its canals are rapidly choked, its vital processes
cease, and it dies. In this part of India, therefore, most sponges are
found fixed either to floating objects such as logs of wood, to vertical
objects such as the stems of bulrushes and other aquatic plants, or to
the tips of branches that overhang the water and become submerged during
the "rains." In Calcutta man has unwittingly come to the assistance of
the sponges, not only by digging tanks but also by building
"bathing-ghats" of brick at the edge, and constructing, with æsthetic
intentions if not results, masses of artificial concrete rocks in or
surrounding the water. There are at least two sponges (the typical form
of <i>Spongilla alba</i> and <i>Ephydatia meyeni</i>) which in Calcutta
are only found attached to such objects. The form of <i>S. alba</i>,
however, that is found in ponds of brackish water in the Gangetic delta
has not derived this artificial assistance from man, except in the few
places where brick bridges have been built, and attaches itself to the
stem and roots of a kind of grass that grows at the edge of brackish
water. This sponge seems to have become immune even to mud, the
particles of which are swallowed by its cells and finally got rid of
without blocking up the canals.</p>

<p>Several Indian sponges are only found adhering to stones and rocks.
Among these species <i>Corvospongilla lapidosa</i> and our
representatives of the subgenus <i>Stratospongilla</i> are noteworthy.
Some forms (e.&nbsp;g. <i>Spongilla carteri</i> and <i>S.
crateriformis</i>) seem, however, to be just as much at home in muddy as
in rocky localities, although they avoid the mud itself.</p>

<p>There is much indirect evidence that the larvæ of freshwater sponges
exercise a power of selection as regards the objects to which they affix
themselves on settling down for life.</p>

<p>Few Spongillidæ are found in salt or brackish water, but <i>Spongilla
alba</i> var. <i>bengalensis</i> has been found in both, and is abundant
in the latter; indeed, it has not been found in pure fresh water.
<i>Spongilla travancorica</i> has only been found in slightly brackish
water, while <i>S. lacustris</i> subsp. <i>reticulata</i> and <i>Dosilia
plumosa</i> occur in both fresh and brackish water, although rarely in
the latter. The Spongillidæ are essentially a freshwater family, and
those forms that are found in any but pure fresh water must be regarded
as aberrant or unusually tolerant in their habits, not as primitive
marine forms that still linger halfway to the sea.</p>

id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span><span class="smcap">Animals and Plants
commonly associated with Freshwater Sponges.</span></p>

<p class="center">(a) <i>Enemies.</i></p>

<p>Freshwater sponges have few living enemies. Indeed, it is difficult
to say exactly what is an enemy of a creature so loosely organized as a
sponge. There can be little doubt, in any case, that the neuropteroid
larva (<i>Sisyra indica</i>) which sucks the cells of several species
should be classed in this category, and it is noteworthy that several
species of the same genus also occur in Europe and N. America which also
attack sponges. Other animals that may be enemies are a midge larva
(<i>Tanypus</i> sp.) and certain worms that bore through the parenchyma
(p.&nbsp;93), but I know of no animal that devours sponges bodily, so long as
they are uninjured. If their external membrane is destroyed, they are
immediately attacked by various little fish and also by snails of the
genera <i>Limnæa</i> and <i>Planorbis</i>, and prawns of the genus
<i>Palæmon</i>.</p>

<p>Their most active and obvious enemy is a plant, not an
animal,&mdash;to wit, a filamentous alga that blocks up their canals by
its rapid growth (p.&nbsp;79).</p>

<p class="center">(b) <i>Beneficial Organisms.</i></p>

<p>The most abundant and possibly the most important organisms that may
be considered as benefactors to the Spongillidæ are the green corpuscles
that live in the cells of certain species (fig. 2, p.&nbsp;31), notably
<i>Spongilla lacustris</i>, <i>S. proliferens</i>, and <i>Dosilia
plumosa</i>. I have already said that these bodies are in all
probability algæ which live free in the water and move actively at one
stage of their existence, but some of them are handed on directly from a
sponge to its descendants in the cells of the gemmule. In their
quiescent stage they have been studied by several zoologists, notably by
Sir Ray Lankester<a name="fnanchor_Q" id="fnanchor_Q"></a><a
href="#footnote_Q" class="fnanchor"><sup>[Q]</sup></a> and Dr. W.
Weltner<a name="fnanchor_R" id="fnanchor_R"></a><a href="#footnote_R"
class="fnanchor"><sup>[R]</sup></a>, but the strongest light that has
been cast on their origin is given by the researches of Dr. F. W. Gamble
and Mr. F. Keeble (Q. J. Microsc. Sci. London, xlvii, p.&nbsp;363, 1904, and
li, p.&nbsp;167, 1907). These researches do not refer directly to the
Spongillidæ but to a little flat-worm that lives in the sea,
<i>Convoluta roscoffiensis</i>. The green corpuscles of this worm so
closely resemble those of <i>Spongilla</i> that we are justified in
supposing a similarity of origin. It has been shown by the authors cited
that the green corpuscles of the worm are at one stage minute
free-living organisms provided at one end with four flagella and at the
other with a red pigment spot. The investigators are of the opinion that
these organisms exhibit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50"
id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> the essential characters of the algæ
known as Chlamydomonadæ, and that after they have entered the worm they
play for it the part of an excretory system.</p>

<p>As they exist in the cells of <i>Spongilla</i> the corpuscles are
minute oval bodies of a bright green colour and each containing a highly
refractile colourless granule. A considerable number may be present in a
single cell. It is found in European sponges that they lose their green
colour if the sponge is not exposed to bright sunlight. In India,
however, where the light is stronger, this is not always the case. Even
when the colour goes, the corpuscles can still be distinguished as pale
images of their green embodiment. They are called <i>Chlorella</i> by
botanists, who have studied their life-history but have not yet
discovered the full cycle. See Beyerinck in the Botan. Zeitung for 1890
(vol. xlviii, p.&nbsp;730, pl. vii; Leipzig), and for further references
West's 'British Freshwater Algæ,' p.&nbsp;230 (1904).</p>

<p>The list of beneficent organisms less commonly present than the green
corpuscles includes a <i>Chironomus</i> larva that builds parchment-like
tubes in the substance of <i>Spongilla carteri</i> and so assists in
supporting the sponge, and of a peculiar little worm (<i>Chætogaster
spongillæ</i><a name="fnanchor_S" id="fnanchor_S"></a><a
href="#footnote_S" class="fnanchor"><sup>[S]</sup></a>) that appears to
assist in cleaning up the skeleton of the same sponge at the approach of
the hot weather and in setting free the gemmules (p.&nbsp;93).</p>

<p class="center">(c) <i>Organisms that take shelter in the Sponge or
adhere to it externally.</i></p>

<p>There are many animals which take shelter in the cavities of the
sponge without apparently assisting it in any way. Among these are the
little fish <i>Gobius alcockii</i>, which lays its eggs inside the
oscula of <i>S. carteri</i>, thus ensuring not only protection but also
a proper supply of oxygen for them (p.&nbsp;94); the molluscs
(<i>Corbula</i>, spp.) found inside <i>S. alba</i> var.
<i>bengalensis</i> (p.&nbsp;78); and the Isopod (<i>Tachæa spongillicola</i>)
that makes its way into the oscula of <i>Spongilla carteri</i> and <i>S.
crateriformis</i> (pp.&nbsp;86, 94).</p>

<p>In Europe a peculiar ciliated Protozoon (<i>Trichodina spongillæ</i>)
is found attached to the external surface of freshwater sponges. I have
noticed a similar species at Igatpuri on <i>Spongilla crateriformis</i>,
but it has not yet been identified. It probably has no effect, good or
bad, on the sponge.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Freshwater Sponges in relation
to Man.</span></p>

<p>In dealing with <i>Spongilla carteri</i> I have suggested that
sponges may be of some hygienic importance in absorbing putrid organic
matter from water used both for ablutionary and for drinking purposes,
as is so commonly the case with regard to ponds in India. Their bad
odour has caused some species of Spongillidæ<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> to be regarded as capable
of polluting water, but a mere bad odour does not necessarily imply that
they are insanitary.</p>

<p>Unless my suggestion that sponges purify water used for drinking
purposes by absorbing putrid matter should prove to be supported by
fact, the Spongillidæ cannot be said to be of any practical benefit to
man. The only harm that has been imputed to them is that of polluting
water<a name="fnanchor_T" id="fnanchor_T"></a><a href="#footnote_T"
class="fnanchor"><sup>[T]</sup></a>, of blocking up water-pipes by their
growth&mdash;a very rare occurrence,&mdash;and of causing irritation to
the human skin by means of their spicules&mdash;a still rarer one. At
least one instance is, however, reported in which men digging in a place
where a pond had once been were attacked by a troublesome rash probably
due to the presence of sponge-spicules in the earth, and students of the
freshwater sponges should be careful not to rub their eyes after
handling dried specimens.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Indian Spongillidæ Compared
With Those of Other Countries.</span></p>

<p>In Weltner's catalogue of the freshwater sponges (1895) seventy-six
recent species of Spongillidæ (excluding <i>Lubosmirskia</i>) are
enumerated, and the number now known is well over a hundred. In India we
have twenty-nine species, subspecies, and varieties, while from the
whole of Europe only about a dozen are known. In the neighbourhood of
Calcutta nine species, representing three genera and a subgenus, have
been found; all of them occur in the Museum tank. The only other region
of similar extent that can compare with India as regards the richness of
its freshwater sponge fauna is that of the Amazon, from which about
twenty species are known. From the whole of North America, which has
probably been better explored than any other continent so far as
Spongillidæ are concerned, only twenty-seven or twenty-eight species
have been recorded.</p>

<p>The Indian species fall into seven genera, one of which
(<i>Spongilla</i>) consists of three subgenera. With one exception (that
of <i>Pectispongilla</i>, which has only been found in Southern India)
these genera have a wide distribution over the earth's surface, and this
is also the case as regards the subgenera of Spongilla. Four genera
(<i>Heteromeyenia</i>, <i>Acalle</i>, <i>Parmula</i>, and
<i>Uruguaya</i>) that have not yet been found in India are known to
exist elsewhere.</p>

<p>Five of the Indian species are known to occur in Europe, viz.,
<i>Spongilla lacustris</i>, <i>S. crateriformis</i>, <i>S. carteri</i>,
<i>S. fragilis</i>, <i>Trochospongilla pennsylvanica</i>; while
<i>Ephydatia meyeni</i> is intermediate between the two commonest
representatives of its genus in the Holarctic Zone, <i>Ephydatia
fluviatilis</i> and <i>E. mülleri</i>. Of the species that occur both in
India and in Europe, two (<i>Spongilla</i><span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> <i>lacustris</i> and
<i>S. fragilis</i>) are found in this country in forms sufficiently
distinct to be regarded as subspecies or local races. Perhaps this
course should also be taken as regards the Indian forms of <i>S.
carteri</i>, of which, however, the commonest of the Indian races would
be the typical one; but <i>S. crateriformis</i> and <i>T.
pennsylvanica</i> seem to preserve their specific characters free from
modification, whether they are found in Europe, Asia, or America.</p>

<p>The freshwater sponges of Africa have been comparatively little
studied, but two Indian species have been discovered, <i>S.
bombayensis</i> in Natal and <i>S. alba</i> var. <i>cerebellata</i> in
Egypt. Several of the species from the Malabar Zone are, moreover,
closely allied to African forms (p.&nbsp;11).</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Fossil Spongillidæ.</span></p>

<p>The Spongillidæ are an ancient family. Young described a species
(<i>Spongilla purbeckensis</i>) from the Upper Jurassic of Dorset (Geol.
Mag. London (new series) v, p.&nbsp;220 (1878)), while spicules, assigned by
Ehrenberg to various genera but actually those of <i>Spongilla
lacustris</i> or allied forms, have been found in the Miocene of Bohemia
(see Ehrenberg's 'Atlas für Micro-Geologie,' pl. xi (Leipzig, 1854), and
Traxler in Földt. Közl., Budapest, 1895, p.&nbsp;211). <i>Ephydatia</i> is
also known in a fossil condition, but is probably less ancient than
<i>Spongilla</i>.</p>

<p>Ehrenberg found many sponge spicules in earth from various parts of
the Indian Empire (including Baluchistan, Mangalore, Calcutta, the
Nicobars and Nepal) and elsewhere, and it might be possible to guess at
the identity of some of the more conspicuous species figured in his
'Atlas.' The identification of sponges from isolated spicules is,
however, always a matter of doubt, and in some cases Ehrenberg probably
assigned spicules belonging to entirely different families or even
orders to the same genus, while he frequently attributed the different
spicules of the same species to different genera. Among his fossil (or
supposed fossil) genera that may be assigned to the Spongillidæ wholly
or in part are <i>Aphidiscus</i>, <i>Spongolithis</i>,
<i>Lithastericus</i> and <i>Lithosphæridium</i>, many of the species of
these "genera" certainly belonging to <i>Spongilla</i> and
<i>Ephydatia</i>.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Oriental Spongillidæ not yet
found in India.</span></p>

<p>Few freshwater sponges that have not been found in India are as yet
known from the Oriental Region, and there is positive as well as
negative evidence that Spongillidæ are less abundant in Malaysia than in
this country. The following list includes the names of those that have
been found, with notes regarding each species. It is quite possible that
any one of them may be found at any time within the geographical

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">History of the Study of Freshwater
Sponges.</span></p>

<p>The bath-sponge was known to the Greeks at an early date, and Homer
refers to it as being used for cleansing furniture, for expunging
writing, and for ablutionary purposes. He also mentions its peculiar
structure, "with many holes." "Many things besides," wrote the English
naturalist Ray in his 'Historia Plantarum' (1686), "regarding the powers
and uses of sponges have the Ancients: to them refer." Ray himself
describes at least one freshwater species, which had been found in an
English river, and refers to what may be another as having been brought
from America. In the eighteenth century Linné, Pallas and other authors
described the commoner European Spongillidæ in general terms, sometimes
as plants and sometimes as animals, more usually as zoophytes or
"plant-animals" partaking of the nature of both kingdoms. The gemmules
were noted and referred to as seeds. The early naturalists of the
Linnæan Epoch, however, added little to the general knowledge of the
Spongillidæ, being occupied with theory in which theological disputes
were involved rather than actual observation, and, notwithstanding the
fact that the animal nature of sponges was clearly demonstrated by
Ellis<a name="fnanchor_U" id="fnanchor_U"></a><a href="#footnote_U"
class="fnanchor"><sup>[U]</sup></a> in 1765, it was not until the
nineteenth century was well advanced that zoologists could regard
sponges in anything like an impartial manner.</p>

<p>One of the pioneers in the scientific study of the freshwater<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> forms
was the late Dr. H. J. Carter, who commenced his investigations, and
carried out a great part of them, in Bombay with little of the apparatus
now considered necessary, and with a microscope that must have been
grossly defective according to modern ideas. His long series of papers
(1848-1887) published in the 'Annals and Magazine of Natural History' is
an enduring monument to Indian zoology, and forms the best possible
introduction to the study of the Spongillidæ. Even his earlier mistakes
are instructive, for they are due not so much to actual errors in
observation as to a faithful transcription of what was observed with
faulty apparatus.</p>

<p>Contemporary with Carter were two authors whose monographs on the
freshwater sponges did much to advance the study of the group, namely,
J. S. Bowerbank, whose account of the species known at the time was
published in the 'Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London' in
1882, and the veteran American naturalist Mr. Edward Potts, whose study
of the freshwater sponges culminated in his monograph published in the
'Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia' in
1887. Carter's own revision of the group was published in the 'Annals
and Magazine of Natural History' in 1881. The names of Vejdovsky, who
prefaced Potts's monograph with an account of the European species, and
of Dybowsky, who published several important papers on classification,
should also be mentioned, while Weltner's catalogue of the known species
(1895) is of the greatest possible value to students of the group.</p>

<p>Many authors have dealt with the physiology, reproduction and
development of the Spongillidæ, especially in recent years; Dr. R.
Evans's description of the larva of <i>Spongilla lacustris</i> (1899),
and his account of the development of the gemmule in <i>Ephydatia
blembingia</i> (1901), Zykoff's account of the development of the
gemmule and of the sponge from the gemmule (1892), and Weltner's
observations on colour and other points (1893, 1907), may be mentioned
in particular. Laurent's observations on development (1844), which were
published in the 'Voyage de la Bonite,' and especially the exquisite
plates which accompany them, have not received the notice they deserve,
probably on account of their method of publication.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Literature.</span></p>

<p>The fullest account of the literature on the Spongillidæ as yet
published will be found in the first of Weltner's 'Spongillidenstudien'
(Archiv für Naturgeschichte, lix (i), p.&nbsp;209, 1893). Unfortunately it
contains no references of later date than 1892. The following list is
not a complete bibliography, but merely a list of books and papers that
should prove of use to students of the Oriental Spongillidæ.</p>

<p class="p2">Freshwater Halichondrina which at certain seasons produce
gemmules armed with peculiar microscleres. Two distinct kinds of
microsclere are often present, that associated with the gemmule
sometimes consisting of a vertical shaft at the ends of which transverse
disks or rotulæ are borne. There is always at least a trace of a
subdermal cavity.</p>

<p>Many authors divide the Spongillidæ into two
subfamilies:&mdash;Spongillinæ (or Euspongillinæ), in which the
gemmule-spicules have no transverse rotulæ, and Meyeninæ (or
Ephydatiinæ), in which they have rotules at one or both ends. So
gradual, however, is the transition that I find it difficult to decide
in one instance to which of two genera, typical respectively of the two
"subfamilies," a species should be assigned. Minchin in his account of
the Porifera in Lankester's "Treatise on Zoology" (1900) regards the
Spongillidæ merely as a subfamily of the Heterorrhaphidæ, and there
certainly are few differences of a definite nature between them and the
marine family (or subfamily) Remeridæ.</p>

<p>The most distinct genus of Spongillidæ not yet found in India is
<i>Heteromeyenia</i>, Potts. It is easily distinguished from all others
by the fact that the birotulate spicules of the gemmule are of two quite
distinct kinds, which occur together on every mature gemmule.
<i>Heteromeyenia</i> is represented by several American species, one of
which has been found in Europe. <i>Acalle</i>, J. E. Gray, which is
represented by a single South American species (<i>Spongilla
recurvata</i>, Bowerbank), is related to <i>Heteromeyenia</i> but has
one kind of gemmule-spicule tubelliform, the other birotulate. Probably
<i>Uraguaya</i>, Carter, should be regarded as a subgenus of
<i>Trochospongilla</i> with an unusually solid skeleton; it is peculiar
to S. America. <i>Parmula</i>, Carter (=<i>Drulia</i>, Gray) includes
South American forms allied to <i>Tubella</i>, but with the shaft of the
gemmule-spicule degenerate and consisting of a mere projection in the
centre of a shield-like body, which represents the lower rotule. The
status of <i>Potamolepis</i>, Marshall, originally described from the
Lake of Galilee, is very doubtful; possibly some or all of its species
belong to the subgenus of <i>Spongilla</i> here called
<i>Stratospongilla</i> (p.&nbsp;100); but they are stated never to produce
gemmules. The same is the case as regards <i>Pachydictyum</i>, Weltner,
which consists of a single species from Celebes.</p>

<p>The sponges from Lake Baikal assigned by Weltner (Arch. Naturg. lxi
(i) p.&nbsp;131) to the subfamily Lubomirskinæ are of doubtful position and
need not be considered here; while <i>Lessepsia</i>, Keller, from one of
the salt lakes on the Suez Canal, certainly does not belong to the
family, although it is assigned to it by von Lendenfeld (Mon. Horny
Sponges, p.&nbsp;904 (1889)) and subsequently by Minchin (Porifera, p.&nbsp;152,
in Lankester's Treatise on Zoology, part ii (1900)).</p>

<p>Spongillidæ in which the gemmules have (normally) cylindrical or
subcylindrical spicules that are sharp or blunt at the ends, without a
distinct transverse disk or disks and without comb-like vertical rows of
spines.</p>

<p>The skeleton is variable in structure, sometimes being almost
amorphous, sometimes having well-defined radiating and transverse fibres
firmly compacted with spongin. The skeleton-spicules are either sharp or
blunt at the ends. Flesh-spicules are often absent; when present they
are needle-like and resemble the gemmule-spicules in general structure;
they have not even rudimentary rotules at their ends. The gemmules
either lie free in the substance of the sponge or are attached to its
support; sometimes they adhere together in free or attached groups.</p>

<p><i>Spongilla</i> is undoubtedly the most primitive genus of the
Spongillidæ, its spicules showing less sign of specialization than those
of any other genus included in the family. As a fossil it goes back at
any rate to the Upper Jurassic (p.&nbsp;52).</p>

<p>Spongillæ in which the gemmules are covered with a thick, apparently
granular pneumatic coat. A delicate membrane often occurs outside this

the sponge but sometimes adhere to its support; rarely they are fastened

<p class="blockquote">[I have not attempted to give a detailed synonymy
of this common species. There is no means of telling whether many of the
earlier names given to forms or allies of <i>S. lacustris</i> are actual
synonyms, and it would serve no useful purpose, so far as the fauna of
India is concerned, to complicate matters by referring to obscure
descriptions or possible descriptions of a species only represented in
India, so far as we know, by a specialized local race, to which separate
references are given.]</p>

<p><i>Sponge</i> soft and easily compressed, very brittle when dry,
usually consisting of a flat or rounded basal portion of no great depth
and of long free cylindrical branches, which droop when removed from the
water; branches occasionally absent. Colour bright green when the sponge
is growing in a strong light, dirty flesh-colour when it is growing in
the shade. (Even in the latter case<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> traces of the "green
corpuscles" can be detected in the cells of the parenchyma.) Oscula
star-shaped, of moderate size, as a rule rendered conspicuous by the
furrows that radiate from them over the outer surface of the parenchyma
below the external membrane; oscular collars well developed.</p>

<p><i>Skeleton</i> reticulate, loose, with definite radiating and
transverse fibres held together by a small quantity of spongin; the
fibres slender but not extremely so.</p>

<p><i>Spicules.</i> Skeleton-spicules smooth, sharply pointed, long,
slender. Flesh-spicules slender, covered with small spines, sharply
pointed, nearly straight. Gemmule-spicules resembling the flesh-spicules
but shorter and as a rule more strongly curved, sometimes bent so as to
form semicircular figures, usually pointed somewhat abruptly; their
spines relatively longer than those of the flesh-spicules, often curved
backwards, especially near the ends of the spicules, at which points
they are often longer than elsewhere.</p>

<p><i>Gemmules</i> usually numerous in autumn, lying free in the sponge,
spherical, variable in size but usually rather large, as a rule covered
with a thick granular coat in which the spicules are arranged
tangentially; a horizontal layer of spicules often present in the
external membrane; the granular coat and its spicules occasionally
deficient. No foraminal tubule; its place sometimes taken by an open,
bowl-shaped chitinous structure the base of which is in continuity with
the inner chitinous coat of the gemmule.</p>

<p><i>S. lacustris</i> is an extremely variable species, varying in the
size, proportions and shape of its spicules, in its external form and in
the size and structure of the gemmule. A considerable number of
varieties have been described from different parts of Europe and N.
America, but some of these may represent distinct but closely-allied
species; descriptions of most of them will be found in Potts's
"Fresh-Water Sponges." The embryology and the earlier stages of the
development from the egg have been described in great detail by Evans
(Quart. J. Micr. Sci. (n. s.) xlii, p.&nbsp;363 (1899)), while the anatomy
and physiology are discussed by most authors who have written on these
features in the Spongillidæ.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Type.</span>&mdash;It is impossible to say who
was the first authority to use the name <i>Spongilla lacustris</i> in
the sense in which it is used by recent authors. No type can therefore
be <ins title="changed from 'recognzied'">recognized</ins>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Geographical Distribution.</span>&mdash;<i>S.
lacustris</i> occurs all over Europe and N. America and is probably the
commonest species in most parts of both continents. It has also been
found in Northern Asia and may occur in the Himalayan lakes and in the
north-west of India.</p>

<p>This race differs from the typical <i>S. lacustris</i> in the
following particulars:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent1a">(1) The branches are always compressed and
anastomose freely when well developed (fig.&nbsp;5, p.&nbsp;<a

<p class="indent1b">(2) the skeleton-fibres are finer;</p>

<p class="indent1b">(3) the skeleton-spicules are longer;</p>

<p class="indent1c">(4) the gemmule-spicules are longer and more slender
and are never strongly bent.</p>

<p>As regards the form of the skeleton- and gemmule-spicules and also
that of the branches the subspecies <i>reticulata</i> resembles <i>S.
alba</i> rather than <i>S. lacustris</i>, but owing to the fact that it
agrees with <i>S. lacustris</i> in its profuse production of branches,
in possessing green corpuscles and in its fragility, I think it should
be associated with that species.</p>

Bombay Presidency. <i>Localities:</i>&mdash;<span

<p><span class="smcap">Biology.</span>&mdash;This subspecies is usually
found in small masses of water, especially in pools of rain-water, but
Mr. Mackenzie found it growing luxuriantly in the Jharai at a time of
flood in September. It is very abundant in small pools among the
sand-dunes that skirt the greater part of the east coast of India. Here
it grows with great rapidity during the "rains," and often becomes
desiccated even more rapidly as soon as the rain ceases. As early in the
autumn as October I have seen masses of the sponge attached, perfectly
dry, to grass growing in the sand near the Sur Lake in Orissa. They
were, of course, dead but preserved a life-like appearance. Some of them
measured about six inches in diameter. At Port Canning the sponge grows
during the rains on the brickwork of bridges over ditches of brackish
water that dry up at the beginning of winter, while at Rajshahi and at
Igatpuri I found it at the edges of small ponds, at the latter place in
November, at the former in February. Specimens taken at Madras by Dr.
Henderson during the rains in small ponds in the sand contained no
gemmules, but these structures are very numerous in sponges examined in
autumn or winter.</p>

<p>Numerous larvæ of <i>Sisyra indica</i> (p.&nbsp;92) were found in this
sponge at Rajshahi. Unlike those obtained from <i>S. alba</i>, they had
a green colour owing to the green matter sucked from the sponge in their
stomachs. The <i>coralloides</i> phase of <i>Plumatella fruticosa</i>
(p.&nbsp;219) was also found in <i>S. lacustris</i> subsp. <i>reticulata</i>
at Rajshahi.</p>

<p>So far as my experience goes, this subspecies has always a bright
green colour due to the presence of "green corpuscles," even when it is
growing in a pond heavily shaded by trees or under the arch of a small
bridge. Probably the more intense light of India enables the corpuscles
to flourish in situations in which in Europe they would lose their
chlorophyll.</p>

Mr. J. Coggin Brown has recently brought back specimens from Yunnan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Biology.</span>&mdash;<i>S. proliferens</i> is
usually found in ponds which never dry up; Prof. Max Weber found it in
small streams in Malaysia. It is common in India on the leaves of
<i>Vallisneria</i> and <i>Limnanthemum</i>, on the roots of <i>Pistia
stratiotes</i> and on the stems of rushes and grass. So far as I have
been able to discover, the life of the individual sponge is short, only
lasting a few weeks.</p>

<p>Sexual reproduction occurs seldom or never, but reproduction by means
of buds and gemmules continues throughout the year. The former is a rare
method of reproduction in most Spongillidæ but in this species occurs
normally and constantly, the buds being often very numerous on the
external surface. They arise a short distance below the surface as
thickenings in the strands of cells that accompany the radiating fibres
of the skeleton. As they grow they push their way up the fibres, forcing
the external membrane outwards. The membrane contracts gradually round
their bases, cuts off communication between them and the parent sponge
and finally sets them adrift. No hole remains when this takes place, for
the membrane closes up both round the base of the bud and over the
aperture whence it has emerged.</p>

<p>The newly liberated bud already possesses numerous minute pores, but
as yet no osculum; its shape exhibits considerable variation, but the
end that was farthest from the parent-sponge before liberation is always
more or less rounded, while the other end is flat. The size also varies
considerably. Some of the buds float, others sink. Those that float do
so either owing to their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75"
id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> shape, which depends on the degree of
development they have reached before liberation, or to the fact that a
bubble of gas is produced in their interior. The latter phenomenon only
occurs when the sun is shining on the sponge at the moment they are set
free, and is due to the action of the chlorophyll of the green bodies so
abundant in certain of the parenchyma cells of this species. If the
liberation of the bud is delayed rather longer than usual, numbers of
flesh-spicules are produced towards the ends of the primary
skeleton-fibres and spread out in one plane so as to have a fan-like
outline; in such buds the form is more flattened and the distal end less
rounded than in others, and the superficial area is relatively great, so
that they float more readily. Those buds that sink usually fall in such
a way that their proximal, flattened end comes in contact with the
bottom or some suspended object, to which it adheres. Sometimes,
however, owing to irregularity of outline in the distal end, the
proximal end is uppermost. In this case it is the distal end that
adheres. Whichever end is uppermost, it is in the uppermost end, or as
it may now be called, the upper surface, that the osculum is formed.
Water is drawn into the young sponge through the pores and, finding no
outlet, accumulates under the external membrane, the subdermal cavity
being at this stage even larger than it is in the adult sponge.
Immediately after adhesion the young sponge flattens itself out. This
process apparently presses together the water in the subdermal cavity
and causes a large part of it to accumulate at one point, which is
usually situated near the centre of the upper surface. A transparent
conical projection formed of the external membrane arises at this point,
and at the tip of the cone a white spot appears. What is the exact cause
of this spot I have not yet been able to ascertain, but it marks the
point at which the imprisoned water breaks through the expanded
membrane, thus forming the first osculum. Before the aperture is formed,
it is already possible to distinguish on the surface of the parenchyma
numerous channels radiating from the point at which the osculum will be
formed to the periphery of the young sponge. These channels as a rule
persist in the adult organism and result from the fact that the inhalent
apertures are situated at the periphery, being absent from both the
proximal and the distal ends of the bud. In the case of floating buds
the course of development is the same, except that the osculum, as in
the case of development from the gemmule in other species (see Zykoff,
Biol. Centrbl. xii, p.&nbsp;713, 1892), is usually formed before adhesion
takes place.</p>

<p>The sponge of <i>S. proliferens</i> is usually too small to afford
shelter to other animals, and I have not found in it any of those
commonly associated with <i>S. carteri</i> and <i>S. alba</i>.</p>

<p>Owing to its small size <i>S. proliferens</i> is more easily kept
alive in an aquarium than most species, and its production of buds can
be studied in captivity. In captivity a curious<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> phenomenon is manifested,
viz. the production of extra oscula, often in large numbers. This is due
either to a feebleness in the currents of the sponge which makes it
difficult to get rid of waste substances or to the fact that the canals
get blocked. The effluent water collects in patches under the external
membrane instead of making its way out of the existing oscula, and new
oscula are formed over these patches in much the same way as the first
osculum is formed in the bud.</p>

<p>The sponge is either devoid of branches or produces irregular,
compressed, and often digitate processes, sometimes of considerable
length and delicacy. Flesh-spicules are usually present throughout the
sponge, but are sometimes absent from one part of a specimen and present
in others. Some of the gemmules are often much smaller than the others.
Perhaps this form should be regarded as a phase rather than a true
variety (see p.&nbsp;18).</p>

<p>All forms of <i>S. alba</i> can be distinguished from all forms of
<i>S. lacustris</i> by the much closer network of the skeleton and by
the consequent hardness of the sponge; also by the complete absence of
green corpuscles.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Biology.</span>&mdash;The typical form of the
species is usually found growing on rocks or bricks at the edges of
ponds, while the variety <i>bengalensis</i> abounds on grass-roots in
pools and swamps of brackish water in the Ganges delta and has been
found on mussel-shells (<i>Modiola jenkinsi</i>, Preston) in practically
salt water in the Chilka Lake. Carter procured the typical form at
Bombay on stones which were only covered for six months in the year, and
"temporarily on floating objects." In Calcutta this form flourishes in
the cold weather on artificial stonework in the "tanks" together with
<i>S. carteri</i>, <i>S. fragilis</i>, <i>Ephydatia meyeni</i>, and
<i>Trochospongilla latouchiana</i>.</p>

<p>The variety <i>bengalensis</i> is best known to me as it occurs in
certain ponds of brackish water at Port Canning on the Mutlah River,
which connects the Salt Lakes near Calcutta with the sea.<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> It
appears in these ponds in great luxuriance every year at the beginning
of the cold weather and often coats the whole edge for a space of
several hundred feet, growing in irregular masses which are more or less
fused together on the roots and stems of a species of grass that
flourishes in such situations. Apparently the tendency for the sponges
to form branches is much more marked in some years than in others (see
Pl. I, figs. 1-3). The gemmules germinate towards the end of the
"rains," and large masses of sponge are not formed much before December.
At this season, however, the level of the water in the ponds sinks
considerably and many of the sponges become dry. If high winds occur,
the dry sponges are broken up and often carried for considerable
distances over the flat surrounding country. In January the gemmules
floating on the surface of the ponds form a regular scum. <i>S. alba</i>
var. <i>bengalensis</i> is the only sponge that occurs in these ponds at
Port Canning, but <i>S. lacustris</i>, subsp. <i>reticulata</i>, is
occasionally found with it on brickwork in the ditches that drain off
the water from the neighbouring fields into the Mutlah estuary. The
latter sponge, however, perishes as these ditches dry up, at an earlier
period than that at which <i>S. alba</i> reaches its maximum
development.</p>

<p>The larvæ of <i>Sisyra indica</i> are commonly found in the oscula of
the typical form of <i>S. alba</i> as well as in those of <i>S.
lacustris</i> subsp. <i>reticulata</i>, and <i>S. carteri</i>; but the
compact structure of the sponge renders it a less suitable residence for
other <i>incolæ</i> than <i>S. carteri</i>.</p>

<p>In the variety <i>bengalensis</i>, as it grows in the ponds at Port
Canning, a large number of arthropods, molluscs and other small animals
take shelter. Apart from protozoa and rotifers, which have as yet been
little studied, the following are some of the more abundant inhabitants
of the sponge:&mdash;The sea-anemone, <i>Sagartia schilleriana</i>
subsp. <i>exul</i> (see p.&nbsp;140), which frequently occurs in very
large numbers in the broader canals; the free-living nematode,
<i>Oncholaimus indicus</i><a name="fnanchor_W" id="fnanchor_W"></a><a
href="#footnote_W" class="fnanchor"><sup>[W]</sup></a>, which makes its
way in and out of the oscula; molluscs belonging to several species of
the genus <i>Corbula</i>, which conceal themselves in the canals but are
sometimes engulfed in the growing sponge and so perish; young
individuals of the crab <i>Varuna litterata</i>, which hide among the
branches and ramifications of the larger sponges together with several
small species of prawns and the schizopod <i>Macropsis orientalis</i><a
name="fnanchor_X" id="fnanchor_X"></a><a href="#footnote_X"
class="fnanchor"><sup>[X]</sup></a>; the <ins title="changed from
'pecular'">peculiar</ins> amphipod <i>Quadrivisio bengalensis</i><a
name="fnanchor_Y" id="fnanchor_Y"></a><a href="#footnote_Y"
class="fnanchor"><sup>[Y]</sup></a>, only known from the ponds at Port
Canning, which breeds in little communities inside the sponge; a small
isopod<a name="fnanchor_Z" id="fnanchor_Z"></a><a href="#footnote_Z"
class="fnanchor"><sup>[Z]</sup></a>, allied to<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> <i>Sphæroma walkeri</i>,
Stebbing; the larva of a may-fly, and those of at least two midges
(Chironomidæ).</p>

<p>The peculiarly mixed nature (marine and lacustrine) of the fauna
associated with <i>S. alba</i> in the ponds at Port Canning is well
illustrated by this list, and it only remains to be stated that little
fish (<i>Gobius alcockii</i>, <i>Barbus stigma</i>, <i>Haplochilus
melanostigma</i>, <i>H. panchax</i>, etc.) are very common and feed
readily on injured sponges. They are apparently unable to attack a
sponge so long as its external membrane is intact, but if this membrane
is broken, they swarm round the sponge and devour the parenchyma
greedily. In fresh water one of these fishes (<i>Gobius alcockii</i>,
see p.&nbsp;94) lays its eggs in sponges.</p>

<p>The chief enemy of the sponges at Port Canning is, however, not an
animal but a plant, viz., a green filamentous alga which grows inside
the sponge, penetrating its substance, blocking up its canals and so
causing it to die. Similar algæ have been described as being beneficial
to the sponges in which they grow<a name="fnanchor_AA"
id="fnanchor_AA"></a><a href="#footnote_AA"
class="fnanchor"><sup>[AA]</sup></a>, but my experience is that they are
deadly enemies, for the growth of such algæ is one of the difficulties
which must be fought in keeping sponges alive in an aquarium. The alga
that grows in <i>S. alba</i> often gives it a dark green colour, which
is, however, quite different from the bright green caused by the
presence of green corpuscles. The colour of healthy specimens of the
variety <i>bengalensis</i> is a rather dark grey, which appears to be
due to minute inorganic particles taken into the cells of the parenchyma
from the exceedingly muddy water in which this sponge usually grows. If
the sponge is found in clean water, to whichever variety of the species
it belongs, it is nearly white with a slight yellowish tinge. Even when
the typical form is growing in close proximity to <i>S. proliferens</i>,
as is often the case, no trace of green corpuscles is found in its
cells.</p>

<p>This sponge is easily distinguished from its Indian allies by the
form of its skeleton-spicules, which are, as Bowerbank expresses it,
"subspined"; that it to say, under a high power of the microscope their
outline appears to be very minutely serrated, although under a low power
they seem to be quite smooth. The spicules also are smaller than those
of <i>S. alba</i>, the only species with which <i>S. cinerea</i> is
likely to be confused, and the gemmule has a well-developed foraminal
tubule; the skeleton is much closer than in <i>S. proliferens</i>.</p>

sharply pointed, often constricted off and expanded so as to resemble
spear-heads, occasionally blunt. No true flesh-spicules.
Gemmule-spicules often free in the parenchyma, cylindrical, slender,
very variable in length in different sponges, straight or nearly so, as
a rule with an irregular circle of strong straight or recurved spines at
either end resembling a rudimentary rotule, and with shorter straight
spines scattered on the shaft, sometimes without the rudimentary rotule,
either truncate at the ends or terminating in a sharp spine.</p>

horizontal spicules; foramen situated at the base of a crater-like
depression in the granular coat, which is sometimes raised round it so
as to form a conspicuous rampart; a short, straight foraminal
tubule.</p>

<p>The shape of the spicules is extremely variable, and sponges in which
they are very different occur in the same localities and even in the
same ponds. It is possible that the differences are directly due to
slight changes in the environment, for in one pond in Calcutta a form
with <i>Spongilla</i>-like gemmule-spicules appears to replace the
typical form, which is common in winter, during the hot weather and
"rains." I have not, however, found this to be the case in other ponds.
Perhaps <i>S. hemephydatia</i> will ultimately prove to be a variety of
this very variable species, but its smooth and regular skeleton-spicules
and short-spined gemmule-spicules afford a ready method of
distinguishing it from <i>S. crateriformis</i>. The two sponges are
easily distinguished from all others in the subgenus <i>Euspongilla</i>
by the upright and regular arrangement of their gemmule-spicules, for
although in <i>S. proliferens</i> and <i>S. travancorica</i> some of the
gemmule-spicules are nearly vertical, their arrangement is always
irregular, a large proportion of the spicules make an acute angle with
the inner coat of the gemmule and a few as a rule lie parallel to it.
The systematic position of <i>S. crateriformis</i> is almost exactly
intermediate between <i>Euspongilla</i> and <i>Ephydatia</i>, to which
genus it has hitherto been assigned. I think, however, that taking into
consideration its close relationship to <i>S. hemephydatia</i>, it is
best to assign it to <i>Spongilla</i>, as its rudimentary rotules never
form distinct disks. I have examined some of Potts's original specimens
from different American localities and can detect no constant difference
between them and Indian specimens.</p>

crateriformis</i> flourishes in Calcutta throughout the year. Here it is
usually found adhering to the roots of water-plants, especially
<i>Pistia</i> and <i>Limnanthemum</i>. In the case of the former it
occurs at the surface, in that of the latter at the bottom. When growing
near the surface or even if attached to a stone at the bottom in clear
water, it is invariably of a pale yellowish or greyish colour. When
growing on the roots of <i>Limnanthemum</i> in the mud of the Gangetic
alluvium, however, it is almost black, and when growing in the reddish
muddy waters of the tanks round Bangalore of a reddish-brown colour.
This appears to be due entirely to the absorption of minute particles of
inorganic matter by the cells of the parenchyma. If black sponges of the
species are kept alive in clean water, they turn pure white in less than
a week, apparently because these particles are eliminated. When growing
on stones the sponge, as found in India, often conforms exactly with
Potts's description: "a filmy grey sponge, branching off here and there
... yet with a curious lack of continuity...."</p>

<p>The wide efferent canals of this sponge afford a convenient shelter
to small crustacea, and the isopod <i>Tachæa spongillicola</i>, Stebbing
(see p.&nbsp;94), is found in them more abundantly than in those of any
other sponge. This is especially the case when the sponge is growing at
the bottom. On the surface of the sponge I have found a peculiar
protozoon which resembles the European <i>Trichodina spongillæ</i> in
general structure but belongs, I think, to a distinct species, if not to
a distinct genus.</p>

<p><i>Sponge</i> massive, as a rule with the surface smooth and rounded,
occasionally bearing irregular ridges, which may even take the form of
cockscombs; the oscula large, rounded, conspicuous but not raised above
the surface of the sponge, leading into broad vertical<span

canals; the lateral canals, except in the immediate vicinity of the
central vertical ones, not very broad; the oscular collars extending for
a considerable distance over the oscula in living or well-preserved
specimens, never standing out from the surface; the oscula never
surrounded by radiating furrows. The inhalent pores surrounded
externally by unmodified cells of the external membrane. Colour greyish,
sometimes with a flush of green on the external surface.</p>

<p>The sponge has a peculiarly strong and offensive smell.</p>

<p><i>Skeleton</i> fairly compact, with well-developed radiating fibres;
the transverse fibres splayed out at either end so that they sometimes
resemble a pair of fans joined together by the handles (fig. 3,
p.&nbsp;33). A moderate amount of spongin present.</p>

<p><i>Spicules.</i> Skeleton-spicules smooth, pointed, nearly straight,
never very stout but somewhat variable in exact proportions.
Gemmule-spicules similar but much smaller. (There are no true
flesh-spicules, but immature skeleton-spicules may easily be mistaken
for them.)</p>

<p><i>Gemmules</i> as a rule numerous, spherical or flattened at the
base, variable in size, each covered by a thick coat consisting of
several layers of relatively large polygonal air-spaces. A single
aperture surrounded by a crater-like depression in the cellular coat and
provided with a foraminal tubule resembling an inverted bottle in shape.
(This tubule, which does not extend beyond the surface of the cellular
coat, is liable to be broken off in dried specimens.) The spicules
variable in quantity, arranged irregularly among the spaces of the
cellular coat and usually forming a sparse horizontal layer on its
external surface. Each gemmule contained in a cage of skeleton-spicules,
by the pressure of which it is frequently distorted.</p>

<p class="p2">8<i>a.</i> Var. <b>mollis</b>*, nov.</p>

<p>This variety is characterized by a paucity of skeleton-spicules. The
sponge is therefore soft and so fragile that it usually breaks in pieces
if lifted from the water by means of its support. Owing to the paucity
of skeleton-spicules, which resemble those of the typical form
individually, the radiating and transverse fibres are extremely
delicate.</p>

<p>Common in Calcutta.</p>

<p class="p2">8<i>b.</i> Var. <b>cava</b>*, nov.</p>

<p>This variety is characterized by the fact that the oscula open into
broad horizontal canals, the roof of which is formed by a thin layer of
parenchyma and skeleton or, in places, of the external membrane only.
The skeleton is loose and fragile, and the living sponge has a peculiar
glassy appearance. In spirit the colour is yellowish, during life it is
greenish or white.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg

<p>The greater part of the sponge in this variety consists of a number
of compressed but pointed vertical lobes, which arise from a relatively
shallow, rounded base, in which the oscula occur. The dried sponge has a
yellowish colour.</p>

<p>Apparently common in Travancore.</p>

<p class="center">*     *     *     *     *</p>

<p>I cannot distinguish these three "varieties"<a name="fnanchor_AC"
id="fnanchor_AC"></a><a href="#footnote_AC"
class="fnanchor"><sup>[AC]</sup></a> from the typical form as distinct
species; indeed, their status as varieties is a little doubtful in two
cases out of the three. Var. <i>cava</i> appears to be a variety in the
strict sense of the word (see p.&nbsp;18), for it was found on the
island of Bombay, the original locality of the species, growing side by
side with the typical form. Var. <i>lobosa</i>, however, should perhaps
be regarded as a subspecies rather than a variety, for I have received
specimens from two localities in the extreme south-west of India and
have no evidence that the typical form occurs in that part of the
country. Evidence, however, is rather scanty as regards the occurrence
of freshwater sponges in S. India. Var. <i>mollis</i>, again, may be a
phase directly due to environment. It is the common form in the ponds of
certain parts (<i>e.&nbsp;g.</i> in the neighbourhood of the Maidan and
at Alipore) of the Calcutta municipal area, but in ponds in other parts
(<i>e.&nbsp;g.</i> about Belgatchia) of the same area, only the typical
form is found. It is possible that the water in the former ponds may be
deficient in silica or may possess some other peculiarity that renders
the production of spicules difficult for <i>S. carteri</i>; but this
seems hardly probable, for <i>S. crassissima</i>, a species with a
rather dense siliceous skeleton, flourishes in the same ponds. I have
noticed that in ponds in which the aquatic vegetation is luxuriant and
such genera of plants as <i>Pistia</i> and <i>Limnanthemum</i> flourish,
there is always a tendency for <i>S. carteri</i> to be softer than in
ponds in which the vegetation is mostly cryptogamic, and in Calcutta
those parts of the town in which sponges of this species produce most
spicules are those in which a slight infiltration of brackish water into
the ponds may be suspected; but in the interior of India, in places
where the water is absolutely fresh, hard specimens seem to be the rule
rather than the exception.</p>

<p><i>S. carteri</i> is closely related to <i>S. nitens</i>, Carter
(Africa, and possibly S. America), but differs from that species in its
comparatively slender, sharp skeleton-spicules and smooth
gemmule-spicules. It may readily be distinguished from all other Indian
freshwater sponges by its large, deep, round oscula, but this feature is
not so marked in var. <i>lobosa</i> as in the other forms. The typical
form and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg
90]</a></span> var. <i>mollis</i> grow to a larger size than is recorded
for any other species of the family. I possess a specimen of the typical
form from the neighbourhood of Calcutta which measures 30 × 27 cm. in
diameter and 19.5 cm. in depth, and weighs (dry) 24-3/4 oz. The base of
this specimen, which is solid throughout, is nearly circular, and the
general form is mound-shaped. Another large specimen from Calcutta is in
the form of an irregular wreath, the greatest diameter of which is 34
cm. This specimen weighs (dry) 16-1/4 oz. Both these specimens probably
represent the growth of several years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Types.</span>&mdash;The types of the varieties
<i>mollis</i>, <i>cava</i> and <i>lobosa</i> are in the collection of
the Indian Museum. I regard as the type of the species the specimen sent
by Carter to Bowerbank and by him named <i>S. carteri</i>, although,
owing to some confusion, Carter's description under this name appeared
some years before Bowerbank's. This specimen is in the British Museum,
with a fragment in the Indian Museum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Geographical Distribution.</span>&mdash;The range
of the species extends westwards to Hungary, southwards to Mauritius and
eastwards to the island of Madura in the Malay Archipelago; a specimen
from Lake Victoria Nyanza in Central Africa has been referred to it by
Kirkpatrick (P. Zool. Soc. London, 1906 (i), p.&nbsp;219), but I doubt
whether the identification is correct. In India <i>S. carteri</i> is by
far the most universally distributed and usually much the commonest
freshwater sponge; it is one of the only two species as yet found in
Ceylon. Specimens are known from the following localities:&mdash;<span

<p><span class="smcap">Biology.</span>&mdash;<i>S. carteri</i> usually
grows in ponds and lakes; I have never seen it in running water. Mr.
Mackenzie found it on the walls of old indigo wells in Tirhut.</p>

<p>The exact form of the sponge depends to some extent on the<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span> forces
acting on it during life. At Igatpuri, for instance, I found that
specimens attached to the stems of shrubs growing in the lake and
constantly swayed by the wind had their surface irregularly reticulated
with high undulating ridges, while those growing on stones at the bottom
of a neighbouring pond were smooth and rounded.</p>

<p>Sponges of this species do not shun the light.</p>

<p>In Calcutta <i>S. carteri</i> flourishes during the cold weather
(November to March). By the end of March many specimens that have
attached themselves to delicate stems such as those of the leaves of
<i>Limnanthemum</i>, or to the roots of <i>Pistia stratiotes</i>, have
grown too heavy for their support and have sunk down into the mud at the
bottom of the ponds, in which they are quickly smothered. Others fixed
to the end of branches overhanging the water or to bricks at the edge
have completely dried up. A large proportion, however, still remain
under water; but even these begin to show signs of decay at this period.
Their cells migrate to the extremities of the sponge, leaving a mass of
gemmules in the centre, and finally perish.</p>

<p>Few sponges exist in an active condition throughout the hot weather.
The majority of those that do so exhibit a curious phenomenon. Their
surface becomes smoothly rounded and they have a slightly pinkish
colour; the majority of the cells of their parenchyma, if viewed under a
high power of the microscope, can be seen to be gorged with very minute
drops of liquid. This liquid is colourless in its natural condition, but
if the sponge is plunged into alcohol the liquid turns of a dark brown
colour which stains both the alcohol and the sponge almost
instantaneously. Probably the liquid represents some kind of reserve
food-material. Even in the hot weather a few living sponges of the
species may be found that have not this peculiarity, but, in some ponds
at any rate, the majority that survive assume the peculiar summer form,
which I have also found at Lucknow.</p>

<p>Reproduction takes place in <i>S. carteri</i> in three distinct ways,
two of which may be regarded as normal, while the third is apparently
the result of accident. If a healthy sponge is torn into small pieces
and these pieces are kept in a bowl of water, little masses of cells
congregate at the tips of the radiating fibres of the skeleton and
assume a globular form. At first these cells are homogeneous, having
clear protoplasm full of minute globules of liquid. The masses differ
considerably in size but never exceed a few millimetres in diameter. In
about two days differentiation commences among the cells; then spicules
are secreted, a central cavity and an external membrane formed, and an
aperture, the first osculum, appears in the membrane. In about ten days
a complete young sponge is produced, but the details of development have
not been worked out.</p>

<p>The most common normal form of reproduction is by means of gemmules,
which are produced in great numbers towards the end of the cold weather.
If small sponges are kept alive in an aquarium even at the beginning of
the cold weather, they begin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92"
id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span> to produce gemmules almost immediately,
but these gemmules although otherwise perfect, possess few or no
gemmule-spicules. If the sponge becomes desiccated at the end of the
cold weather and is protected in a sheltered place, some or all of the
gemmules contained in the meshes of its skeleton germinate <i>in
situ</i> as soon as the water reaches it again during the "rains." It is
by a continuous or rather periodical growth of this kind, reassumed
season after season, that large masses of sponge are formed. In such
masses it is often possible to distinguish the growth of the several
years, but as a rule the layers become more or less intimately fused
together, for no limiting membrane separates them. A large proportion of
the gemmules are, however, set free and either float on the surface of
the water that remains in the ponds or are dried up and carried about by
the wind. In these circumstances they do not germinate until the
succeeding cold weather, even if circumstances other than temperature
are favourable; but as soon as the cold weather commences they begin to
produce new sponges with great energy.</p>

<p>Sexual reproduction, the second normal form, takes place in <i>S.
carteri</i> mainly if not only at the approach of a change of season,
that is to say about March, just before the hot weather commences, and
about November, just as the average temperature begins to sink to a
temperate level. At these seasons healthy sponges may often be found
full of eggs and embryos, which lie in the natural cavities of the
sponge without protecting membrane.</p>

<p>In the ponds of Calcutta a large number of animals are found
associated in a more or less definite manner with <i>Spongilla
carteri</i>. Only one, however, can be described with any degree of
certainty as being in normal circumstances an enemy, namely the larva of
<i>Sisyra indica</i>,<a name="fnanchor_AD" id="fnanchor_AD"></a><a
href="#footnote_AD" class="fnanchor"><sup>[AD]</sup></a> and even in the
case of this little insect it is doubtful how far its attacks are
actually injurious to the sponge. The larva is often found in
considerable numbers clinging to the oscula and wide efferent canals of
<i>S. carteri</i>, its proboscis inserted into the substance of the
sponge. If the sponge dies and the water becomes foul the larvæ swim or
crawl away. If the sponge dries up, they leave its interior (in which,
however, they sometimes remain for some days after it has become dry)
and pupate in a silken cocoon on its surface. Hence they emerge as
perfect insects after about a week.</p>

<p>An animal that may be an enemy of <i>S. carteri</i> is a flat-worm
(an undescribed species of <i>Planaria</i>) common in its larger canals
and remarkable for the small size of its pharynx. The same worm,
however, is also found at the base of the leaves of bulrushes and in
other like situations, and there is no evidence that it actually feeds
on the sponge. Injured sponges are eaten by the prawn <i>Palæmon
lamarrei</i>, which, however, only attacks them when the dermal membrane
is broken. A <i>Tanypus</i> larva (Chironomid<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> Diptera) that makes its
way though the substance of the sponge may also be an enemy; it is
commoner in decaying than in vigorous sponges.</p>

<p>The presence of another Chironomid larva (<i>Chironomus</i>, sp.)
appears to be actually beneficial. In many cases it is clear that this
larva and the sponge grow up together, and the larva is commoner in
vigorous than in decayed sponges. Unlike the <i>Tanypus</i> larva, it
builds parchment-like tubes, in which it lives, on the surface of the
sponge. The sponge, however, often grows very rapidly and the larva is
soon in danger of being engulfed in its substance. The tube is therefore
lengthened in a vertical direction to prevent this catastrophe and to
maintain communication with the exterior. The process may continue until
it is over an inch in length, the older part becoming closed up owing to
the pressure of the growing sponge that surrounds it. Should the sponge
die, the larva lives on in its tubes without suffering, and the ends of
tubes containing larvæ may sometimes be found projecting from the worn
surface of dead sponges. The larva does not eat the sponge but captures
small insects by means of a pair of legs on the first segment of its
thorax. In so doing it thrusts the anterior part of its body out of the
tube, to the inner surface of which it adheres by means of the pair of
false legs at the tip of the abdomen. This insect, which is usually
found in the variety <i>mollis</i>, appears to do good to the sponge in
two ways&mdash;by capturing other insects that might injure it and by
giving support to its very feeble skeleton.</p>

<p>A precisely similar function, so far as the support of the sponge is
concerned, is fulfilled by the tubular zo&oelig;cia of a phase of the
polyzoon <i>Plumatella fruticosa</i> (see p.&nbsp;218) which in India is
more commonly found embedded in the substance of <i>S. carteri</i> than
in that of any other species, although in Great Britain it is generally
found in that of <i>S. lacustris</i>, which is there the commonest
species of freshwater sponge.</p>

<p>Another animal that appears to play an active part in the
&oelig;conomy of the sponge is a peculiar little worm (<i>Chætogaster
spongillæ</i>) also found among the zo&oelig;cia of <i>Plumatella</i>
and belonging to a widely distributed genus of which several species are
found in association with pond-snails. <i>Chætogaster spongillæ</i>
often occurs in enormous numbers in dead or dying sponges of <i>S.
carteri</i>, apparently feeding on the decaying organic matter of the
sponge and assisting by its movements in releasing numerous gemmules. In
so doing it undoubtedly assists in the dissemination of the species.</p>

<p>Major J. Stephenson (Rec. Ind. Mus. v, p.&nbsp;233) has recently
found two other species of oligochætes inhabiting <i>S. carteri</i> var.
<i>lobosa</i> from Travancore. Both these species, unlike <i>Chætogaster
spongillæ</i>, belong to a genus that is vegetarian in habits. One of
them, <i>Nais pectinata</i>, has not yet been found elsewhere, while the
other, <i>Nais communis</i>, has a very wide distribution. The latter,
however, occurs in the sponge in two forms&mdash;one with eyes, the
other totally blind. The blind form (<i>N. communis</i> var.
<i>cæca</i>) has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg
94]</a></span> only been found in this situation, but the other (var.
<i>punjabensis</i>) lives free as well as in association with the
sponge, in which the blind form was the commoner of the two.</p>

<p>The majority of the animals found in association with <i>S.
carteri</i> gain shelter without evident assistance to the sponge. This
is the case as regards the little fish (<i>Gobius alcockii</i>), one of
the smallest of the vertebrates (length about 1/2 inch), which lays its
eggs in the patent oscula, thus securing for them a situation peculiarly
favourable to their development owing to the constant current of water
that passes over them. In the absence of sponges, however, this fish
attaches its eggs to the floating roots of the water-plant <i>Pistia
stratiotes</i>. Numerous small crustacea<a name="fnanchor_AE"
id="fnanchor_AE"></a><a href="#footnote_AE"
class="fnanchor"><sup>[AE]</sup></a> also take temporary or permanent
refuge in the cavities of <i>S. carteri</i>, the most noteworthy among
them being the Isopod <i>Tachæa spongillicola</i><a name="fnanchor_AF"
id="fnanchor_AF"></a><a href="#footnote_AF"
class="fnanchor"><sup>[AF]</sup></a>, the adults of which are found in
the canal of this and other sponges, while the young cling to the
external surface of the carapace of <i>Palæmon lamarrei</i> and other
small prawns. Many worms and insects of different kinds also enter the
canals of <i>S. carteri</i>, especially when the sponge is becoming
desiccated; from half-dry sponges numerous beetles and flies may be
bred, notably the moth-fly <i>Psychoda nigripennis</i><a
name="fnanchor_AG" id="fnanchor_AG"></a><a href="#footnote_AG"
class="fnanchor"><sup>[AG]</sup></a> of which enormous numbers sometimes
hatch out from such sponges.</p>

<p>As the sponge grows it frequently attaches itself to small molluscs
such as the young of <i>Vivipara bengalensis</i>, which finally become
buried in its substance and thus perish. Possibly their decaying bodies
may afford it nourishment, but of the natural food of sponges we know
little. <i>S. carteri</i> flourishes best and reaches its largest size
in ponds used for domestic purposes by natives of India, and thrives in
water thick with soap-suds. It is possible, though direct proof is
lacking, that the sponge does good in purifying water used for washing
the clothes, utensils, and persons of those who drink the same water, by
absorbing decaying animal and vegetable matter from it.</p>

<p>Various minute algæ are found associated with <i>S. carteri</i>, but
of these little is yet known. The green flush sometimes seen on the
surface of the typical form is due to the fact that the superficial
cells of the parenchyma contain green corpuscles. These, however, are
never very numerous and are not found in the inner parts of the sponge,
perhaps owing to its massive form. It is noteworthy that these green
bodies flourish in large numbers throughout the substance of sponges of
<i>S. proliferens</i>, a species always far from massive, growing in the
same ponds as <i>S. carteri</i>.</p>

which are usually numerous, are slender. The foraminal tubules are
usually long and bent, but are sometimes very short and quite straight.
The colour is usually greyish, occasionally brown.</p>

<p>I have not found this race except in Calcutta, in the ponds of which
it grows on bricks or, very commonly, on the stems of bulrushes, often
covering a considerable area.</p>

<p>This (?) local race is distinguished by the fact that the foraminal
tubules are invariably short and straight and thickened at the tips, and
that gemmule-spicules do not occur on the external surface of the
cellular coat of the gemmules.</p>

<p>I include Weber's <i>Spongilla decipiens</i> in the Indian fauna on
the authority of Weltner, who identified specimens from the Museum
"tank," Calcutta, as belonging to this form. All, however, that I have
examined from our "tank" belong to the subspecies <i>calcuttana</i>,
most of the skeleton-spicules of which are much less sharp than those of
<i>decipiens</i>. By the kindness of Prof. Max Weber I have been able to
examine a co-type of his species, which is probably a local race
peculiar to the Malay Archipelago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Type</span> in the Amsterdam Museum; a co-type in

<p>Perhaps the Japanese form, which has spindle-shaped gemmule-spicules
with comparatively short and regular spines, should be regarded as a
third subspecies, and the Siberian form as a fourth.</p>

<p class="p2">10. <b>Spongilla gemina</b>*, sp. nov.</p>

<p><i>Sponge</i> forming small, shallow, slightly dome-shaped patches of
a more or less circular or oval outline, minutely hispid on the surface,
friable but moderately hard. Oscula numerous but minute and
inconspicuous, never star-shaped. Dermal membrane adhering closely to
the sponge. Colour grey or brown.</p>

<p><i>Skeleton</i> forming a close and regular network at the base of
the sponge, becoming rather more diffuse towards the external surface;
the radiating and the transverse fibres both well developed, of almost
equal diameter. Little spongin present.</p>

<p><i>Spicules.</i> Skeleton-spicules slender, smooth, sharply pointed.
No flesh-spicules. Gemmule-spicules long, slender, cylindrical, blunt or

Each gemmule flattened on the surface by which it is attached to its
twin, covered with a thin coat of polygonal air-spaces which contains
two layers of gemmule-spicules crossing one another irregularly in a
horizontal plane. One or two foraminal<span class='pagenum'><a

<p><span class="smcap">Biology.</span>&mdash;<i>S. crassissima</i> is
usually found near the surface in shallow water. Attached to the roots
of the floating water-plant <i>Pistia stratiotes</i> it assumes a
spherical form, while on sticks or like objects it is spindle-shaped.
Sometimes it is found growing on the same stick or reed-stem as <i>S.
carteri</i>, the two species being in close contact and <i>S.
carteri</i> always overlapping <i>S. crassissima</i>. The dark colour is
due to minute masses of blackish pigment in the cells of the parenchyma.
The dense structure of the sponge is not favourable to the presence of
<i>incolæ</i>, but young colonies of the polyzoon <i>Plumatella
fruticosa</i> are sometimes overgrown by it. Although they may persist
for a time by elongating their tubular zo&oelig;cia through the
substance of the sponge, they do not in these circumstances reach the
same development as when they are overgrown by the much softer <i>S.
carteri</i>.</p>

<p><i>S. crassissima</i> is found during the "rains" and the cold
weather. In Calcutta it attains its maximum size towards the end of the
latter season. In spite of its hard and compact skeleton, the sponge
does not persist from one cold weather to another.</p>

<p>A curious phenomenon has been noticed in this species, but only in
the case of sponges living in an aquarium, viz. the cessation during the
heat of the day of the currents produced by its flagella.</p>

the beginning of summer, in India it is at the beginning of the "cold
weather," that is to say, both the coolest and the driest season of the
year. The lake in which my specimens were obtained had, at the time when
they were collected, already sunk some inches below its highest level,
leaving bare a gently sloping bank of small stones. Adhering to the
lower surface of these stones I found many small patches of <i>Spongilla
bombayensis</i>, quite dry but complete so far as their harder parts
were concerned and with the gemmules fully formed at their base. From
the shallow water at the edge of the lake I took many similar stones
which still remained submerged. It was evident that the sponge had been
just as abundant on their lower surface as on that of the stones which
were now dry; but only the gemmules remained, sometimes with a few
skeleton-spicules adhering to them (Pl. II, fig. 2). The bulk of the
skeleton had fallen away and the parenchyma had wholly perished. In a
few instances a small sponge, one or two millimetres in diameter, had
already been formed among the gemmules; but these young sponges appeared
to belong to some other species, possibly <i>Spongilla indica</i>, which
was also common in the lake.</p>

<p>Carter's specimen of <i>S. bombayensis</i>, which was evidently in
much the same condition as those I found still submerged a<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
month later, was taken in October in a disused quarry. It was surrounded
by a mass of <i>S. carteri</i> three inches in diameter, and was
attached to a herbaceous annual. The point on the edge of the quarry at
which this plant grew was not reached by the water until July. It is
therefore necessary to assume that the gemmules of <i>S. bombayensis</i>
had been formed between July and October. Probably the larva of the
sponge had settled down on the plant during the "rains"&mdash;which
commence in Bombay about the beginning of June&mdash;and had grown
rapidly. The production of gemmules may have been brought about owing to
the sponge being choked by the more vigorous growth of <i>S.
carteri</i>, a species which grows to a considerable size in a
comparatively short time, while <i>S. bombayensis</i> apparently never
reaches a thickness of more than a few millimetres.</p>

<p>The manner in which the gemmules of <i>S. bombayensis</i> are
fastened to the solid support of the sponge must be particularly useful
in enabling them to sprout in a convenient environment as soon as the
water reaches them. The fact that the gemmules remained fixed without
support renders it unnecessary for the skeleton to persist as a cage
containing them (or at any rate a proportion of them) during the period
of rest.</p>

<p>Prof. Weber's specimens of <i>S. bombayensis</i> were collected in a
river, apparently on stones or rocks, towards the beginning of the S.
African summer. They contain comparatively few gemmules and were
evidently in a vigorous condition as regards vegetative growth.
Unfortunately we know nothing of the seasonal changes which take place
in freshwater sponges in S. Africa, but the difference between these
changes in Europe and in India shows that they are dependent on
environment as well as the idiosyncrasy of the species. It is very
interesting, therefore, to see that the condition of sponges taken in S.
Africa differs so widely from that of other individuals of the same
species taken in India at the same season.</p>

<p>In Prof. Weber's specimens I have found numerous small tubules of
inorganic débris. These appear to be the work of Chironomid larvæ, of
which there are several specimens loose in the bottle containing the
sponges. Other tubules of a very similar appearance but with a delicate
chitinoid foundation appear to be the remains of a species of
<i>Plumatella</i> of which they occasionally contain a statoblast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Type</span>, (?) <i>Spongilla fluviatilis</i>,
auctorum.</p>

<p>This genus is separated from <i>Spongilla</i> by the structure of the
gemmule-spicules, which bear at either end a transverse disk with
serrated or deeply notched edges, or at any rate with edges that are
distinctly undulated. The disks are equal and similar. True
flesh-spicules are usually absent, but more or less perfect birotulates
exactly similar to those associated with the gemmules are often found
free in the parenchyma. The skeleton is never very stout and the
skeleton-spicules are usually slender.</p>

<p>As has been already stated, some authors consider <i>Ephydatia</i> as
the type-genus of a subfamily distinguished from the subfamily of which
<i>Spongilla</i> is the type-genus by having rotulate gemmule-spicules.
The transition between the two genera, however, is a very easy one. Many
species of the subgenus <i>Euspongilla</i>, the typical subgenus of
<i>Spongilla</i> (including <i>S. lacustris</i>, the type-species of the
genus), have the spines at the ends of the gemmule-spicules arranged in
such a way as to suggest rudimentary rotules, while in the typical form
of <i>S. crateriformis</i> this formation is so distinct that the
species has hitherto been placed in the genus <i>Ephydatia</i>
(<i>Meyenia</i>), although in some sponges that agree otherwise with the
typical form of the species the gemmule-spicules are certainly not
rotulate and in none do these spicules bear definite disks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Geographical
Distribution.</span>&mdash;<i>Ephydatia</i>, except <i>Spongilla</i>, is
the most generally distributed genus of the Spongillidæ, but in most
countries it is not prolific in species. In Japan, however, it appears
to predominate over <i>Spongilla</i>. Only one species is known from
India, but another (<i>E. blembingia</i>*, Evans) has been described
from the Malay Peninsula, while Weber found both the Indian species and
a third (<i>E. bogorensis</i>*) in the Malay Archipelago.</p>

number of deep, slender, triangular processes of different sizes; the
shaft extending not at all or very little beyond the disks.</p>

<p><i>Gemmules</i> spherical, usually numerous and of rather large size;

three concentric series; a single short foraminal tubule; the pneumatic
coat confined externally by a delicate membrane, with small
funnel-shaped pits over the spicules of the outer series.</p>

<p>I think that the gemmules found by me in Bhim Tal and assigned to
Potts's <i>Meyenia robusta</i> belong to this species, but some of the
spicules are barely as long as the diameter of the disks. In any case
Potts's description is so short that the status of his species is
doubtful. His specimens were from N. America.</p>

<p><i>E. meyeni</i> is closely related to the two commonest Holarctic
species of the genus, <i>E. fluviatilis</i> and <i>E. mülleri</i>, which
have been confused by several authors including Potts. From <i>E.
fluviatilis</i> it is distinguished by the possession of bubble-cells in
the parenchyma, and from <i>E. mülleri</i> by its invariably smooth
skeleton-spicules and the relatively long shafts of its
gemmule-spicules. The latter character is a marked feature of the
specimens from the Malay Archipelago assigned by Prof. Max Weber to
<i>E. fluviatilis</i>; I am indebted to his kindness for an opportunity
of examining some of them.</p>

<p>This genus is distinguished from <i>Ephydatia</i> by the nature of
the free microscleres, the microscleres of the gemmule being <ins
title="changed from 'milar'">similar</ins> in the two genera. The free
microscleres consist as a rule of several or many shafts meeting
together in several or many planes at a common centre, which is usually
nodular. The free ends of these shafts often possess rudimentary rotulæ.
Occasionally a free microsclere may be found that is a true monaxon and
sometimes such spicules are more or less distinctly<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
birotulate. The skeleton is also characteristic. It consists mainly of
radiating fibres which bifurcate frequently in such a way that a
bush-like structure is produced. Transverse fibres are very feebly
developed and are invisible to the naked eye. Owing to the structure of
the skeleton the sponge has a feathery appearance.</p>

<p>Gray originally applied the name <i>Dosilia</i> to this species and
to <i>"Spongilla" baileyi</i>, Bowerbank. It is doubtful how far his
generic description applies to the latter, which I have not seen; but
although the position of <i>"Spongilla" baileyi</i> need not be
discussed here, I may say that I do not regard it as a congener of
<i>Dosilia plumosa</i>, the free microscleres of which are of a nature
rare but not unique in the family. With <i>Dosilia plumosa</i> we must,
in any case, associate in one genus the two forms that have been
described as varieties, viz., <i>palmeri</i>*, Potts from Texas and
Mexico, and <i>brouini</i>*, Kirkpatrick from the White Nile. By the
kindness of the authorities of the Smithsonian Institution and the
British Museum I have been able to examine specimens of all three forms,
in each case identified by the author of the name, and I am inclined to
regard them as three very closely allied but distinct species. Species
with free microscleres similar to those of these three forms but with
heterogeneous or tubelliform gemmule-spicules will probably need the
creation of a new genus or new genera for their reception.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Geographical Distribution.</span>&mdash;The

at Rambha in the north-east of the Madras Presidency. I have been unable
to discover this species in the neighbourhood of Calcutta, but it is
apparently rare wherever it occurs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Biology.</span>&mdash;Carter writes as regards
this species:&mdash;"This is the coarsest and most resistant of all the
species. As yet I have only found three or four specimens of it, and
these only in two tanks.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113"
id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> I have never seen it fixed on any
solid body, but always floating on the surface of the water, about a
month after the first heavy rains of the S.W. monsoon have fallen.
Having made its appearance in that position, and having remained there
for upwards of a month, it then sinks to the bottom. That it grows like
the rest, adherent to the sides of the tank, must be inferred from the
first specimen which I found (which exceeds two feet in circumference)
having had a free and a fixed surface, the latter coloured by the red
gravel on which it had grown. I have noticed it growing, for two
successive years in the month of July, on the surface of the water of
one of the two tanks in which I have found it, and would account for its
temporary appearance in that position, in the following way, viz., that
soon after the first rains have fallen, and the tanks have become
filled, all the sponges in them appear to undergo a partial state of
putrescency, during which gas is generated in them, and accumulates in
globules in their structure, through which it must burst, or tear them
from their attachments and force them to the surface of the water. Since
then the coarse structure of <i>plumosa</i> would appear to offer
greater resistance to the escape of this air, than that of any of the
other species, it is probable that this is the reason of my having
hitherto only found it in the position mentioned."</p>

<p>It seems to me more probable that the sponges are actually broken
away from their supports by the violence of the rain and retain air
mechanically in their cavities. The only specimens of <i>D. plumosa</i>
that I have seen alive were attached very loosely to their support. In
writing of the "coarse structure" of this species, Carter evidently
alludes to the wide interspaces between the component branches of the
skeleton.</p>

<p>My specimens were attached to the stem of a water-lily growing in a
pool of slightly brackish water and were of a brilliant green colour. I
mistook them at first for specimens of <i>S. lacustris</i> subsp.
<i>reticulata</i> in which the branches had not developed normally. They
were taken in March and were full of gemmules. The pool in which they
were growing had already begun to dry up.</p>

<p>I think it best to include in this genus, as the original diagnosis
would suggest, all those species in which all the gemmule-spicules are
definitely birotulate and have smooth edges to their disks, confining
the name <i>Tubella</i> to those in which the upper rotula is reduced to
a mere knob. Even in those species in which the two disks are normally
equal, individual spicules may be found in which the equality is only
approximate, while, on the other hand, it is by no means uncommon for
individual spicules in such species as <i>"Tubella" pennsylvanica</i>,
which is here included in <i>Trochospongilla</i>, to have the two disks
nearly equal, although normally the upper one is much smaller than the
lower. There is very rarely any difficulty, however, in seeing at a
glance whether the edge of the disk is smooth or serrated, the only
species in which this difficulty would arise being, so far as I am
aware, the Australian <i>Ephydatia capewelli</i>* (Haswell), the disks
of which are undulated and nodulose rather than serrated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Geographical Distribution.</span>&mdash;The genus
includes so large a proportion of small, inconspicuous species that its
distribution is probably known but imperfectly. It would seem to have
its headquarters in N. America but also occurs in Europe and Asia. In
India three species have been found, one of which (<i>T.
pennsylvanica</i>) has an extraordinarily wide and apparently
discontinuous range, being common in N. America, and having been found
in the west of Ireland, the Inner Hebrides, and near the west coast of
S. India. The other two Indian species are apparently of not uncommon
occurrence in eastern India and Burma.</p>

<p><i>T. latouchiana</i> is closely related to <i>T. leidyi</i>
(Bowerbank) from N. America, but is distinguished by its much more
slender skeleton-spicules, by the fact that the gemmules are not
enclosed in cages of megascleres or confined to the base of the sponge,
and by differences in the structure of the skeleton.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Biology.</span>&mdash;This species, which is
common in the Museum tank, Calcutta, is apparently one of those that can
grow at any time of year, provided that it is well covered with water.
Like <i>T. leidyi</i> it is capable of producing fresh layers of living
sponge on the top of old ones, from which they are separated by a
chitinous membrane. These layers are not, however, necessarily produced
in different seasons, for it is often clear from the nature of the
object to which the sponge is attached that they must all have been
produced in a short space of time. What appears to happen in most cases
is this:&mdash;A young sponge grows on a brick, the stem of a reed or
some other object at or near the edge<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> of a pond, the water
in which commences to dry up. As the sponge becomes desiccated its cells
perish. Its gemmules are, however, retained in the close-meshed
skeleton, which persists without change of form. A heavy shower of rain
then falls, and the water rises again over the dried sponge. The
gemmules germinate immediately and their contents spread out over the
old skeleton, secrete a chitinous membrane and begin to build up a new
sponge. The process may be repeated several times at the change of the
seasons or even during the hot weather, or after a "break in the rains."
If, however, the dried sponge remains exposed to wind and rain for more
than a few months, it begins to disintegrate and its gemmules are
carried away to other places. Owing to their thin pneumatic coat and
relatively heavy spicules they are not very buoyant. Even in the most
favourable circumstances the sponge of <i>T. latouchiana</i> never forms
sheets of great area. In spite of its rapid growth it is frequently
overgrown by <i>Spongilla carteri</i>.</p>

then rapidly covered by a thin layer of the sponge, which dies down as
soon as the water begins to sink when the "rains" are over. For some
months the gemmules adhere to the wall on account of the cage of
spicules in which each of them is enclosed, but long before the water
rises again the cages disintegrate and the gemmules are set free. Many
of them fall or are carried by the wind into the water, on the surface
of which, owing to their thick pneumatic coat, they float buoyantly.
Others are lodged in cavities in the wall. On the water the force of

<p>This genus is distinguished from <i>Ephydatia</i> and
<i>Trochospongilla</i> by the fact that the two ends of the
gemmule-spicules are unlike not only in size but also in form. It
sometimes happens that this unlikeness is not so marked in some spicules
as in others, but in some if not in all the upper end of the shaft (that
is to say the end furthest removed from the inner coat of the gemmule in
the natural position) is reduced to a rounded knob, while the lower end
expands into a flat transverse disk with a smooth or denticulated edge.
The spicule thus resembles a little trumpet resting on its mouth. The
shaft of the spicule is generally slender and of considerable length.
The skeleton of the sponge is as a rule distinctly reticulate and often
hard; the skeleton-spicules are either slender or stout and sometimes
change considerably in proportions and outline as they approach the
gemmules.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Geographical Distribution.</span>&mdash;The genus
is widely distributed in the tropics of both Hemispheres, its
headquarters apparently being in S. America; but it is nowhere rich in
species. Only two are known from the Oriental Region, namely <i>T.

<p>Spongillidæ in which the gemmule-spicules are without a trace of
rotulæ and the flesh-spicules have slender cylindrical shafts that bear
at or near either end a circle of strong recurved spines. The
gemmule-spicules are usually stout and sausage-shaped, and the gemmules
resemble those of <i>Stratospongilla</i> in structure. The skeleton is
strong and the skeleton-spicules stout, both resembling those of the

are often very numerous and in some cases the skeleton is so compact and
rigid that the sponge may be described as stony. The flesh-spicules

but conspicuous, circular, raised on little turret-like eminences; the
external membrane adhering closely to the sponge.</p>

<p><i>Skeleton</i> dense but by no means regular; the network composed
largely of single spines; thick radiating fibres distinguishable in the
upper part of the sponge.</p>

<p><i>Spicules.</i> Skeleton-spicules smooth, not very stout,
amphistrongylous, occasionally a little swollen at the ends, often with
one or more fusiform swellings, measuring on an average about 0.27 ×
0.0195 mm. Flesh-spicules with distinct rotules, the recurved spines
numbering 4 to 6, measuring about 1/7 the length of the spicules; the
shaft by no means strongly curved; their length from 0.03-0.045 mm.
Gemmule-spicules amphioxous, as a rule distinctly curved, sometimes
swollen at the ends, covered regularly but somewhat sparsely with fine
spines, not measuring more than 0.49 × 0.078 mm.</p>

<p><i>Gemmules</i> strongly adherent, arranged in small groups, either
single or double; when single spherical, when double oval; each gemmule
or pair of gemmules covered by two layers of gemmule-spicules bound
together in chitinous substance; the inner layer on the inner coat of
the gemmule, the outer one separated from it by a space and in contact
with the outer cage of skeleton-spicules; the size of the
gemmule-spicules variable in both layers; external to the outer layer a
dense cage of skeleton-spicules; foraminal tubule short,
cylindrical.</p>

<p>This sponge is closely related to <i>S. loricata</i>, Weltner, of
which Kirkpatrick regards it as a variety. "The main difference," he
writes, "between the typical African form and the Burmese variety
consists in the former having much larger microstrongyles (83 × 15.7 µ
[0.83 × 0.157 mm.]) with larger and coarser spines;... Judging from
Prof. Weltner's sections of gemmules, these bodies lack the definite
outer shell of smooth macrostrongyles [blunt skeleton-spicules], though
this may not improbably be due to the breaking down and removal of this
layer. A further difference consists in the presence, in the African
specimen, of slender, finely spined strongyles [amphistrongyli], these
being absent in the Burmese form, though perhaps this fact is not of
much importance."</p>

an area of six square feet. The beam had been tarred several times
before the sponge was discovered. The portion of the gate on which the
sponge was growing was submerged from November to May for eight hours a
day at spring tides, but was entirely dry during the six days of neap
tides. From May to October it was constantly submerged. The sponge was
found in April. Although the canal is subject to the tides, the water at
the lock is always fresh. The colour of the sponge during life was the

<p>The <i>sponge</i> forms a thin but extremely hard and resistant crust
the surface of which is either level, slightly concave, or distinctly
corrugated; occasional groups of spicules project from it, but their
arrangement is neither so regular nor so close as is the case in <i>C.

oscula are small; some of them are raised above the general surface but
not on regular turret-shaped eminences. The colour is grey or black.
There is a thick chitinous membrane at the base of the sponge.</p>

<p>The <i>skeleton</i> is extremely dense owing to the large number of
spicules it contains, but almost structureless; broad vertical groups of
spicules occur but lack spongin and only traverse a small part of the
thickness of the sponge; their position is irregular. The firmness of
the skeleton is due almost entirely to the interlocking of individual
spicules. At the base of the sponge the direction of a large proportion
of the spicules is horizontal or nearly horizontal, the number arranged
vertically being much greater in the upper part.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg
125]</a></span><i>Spicules.</i> The skeleton-spicules are sausage-shaped
and often a little swollen at the ends or constricted in the middle. A
large proportion are twisted or bent in various ways, and a few bear
irregular projections or swellings. The majority, however, are quite
smooth. Among them a few more or less slender, smooth amphioxi occur,
but these are probably immature spicules. The length and curvature of
the amphistrongyli varies considerably, but the average <ins
title="changed from 'measurments'">measurements</ins> are about 0.28 ×
0.024 mm. The flesh-spicules also vary greatly in length and in the
degree to which their shafts are curved. At first sight it seems to be
possible to separate them into two categories, one in which the shaft is
about 0.159 mm. long, and another in which it is only 0.05 mm. or even
less; and groups of birotulates of approximately the same length often
occur in the interstices of the skeleton. Spicules of all intermediate
lengths can, however, be found. The average diameter of the shaft is
0.0026 mm. and of the rotula 0.0106 mm., and the rotula consists of from
6 to 8 spines. The gemmule-spicules vary greatly in size, the longest
measuring about 0.08 × 0.014 and the smallest about 0.034 × 0.007 or
even less. There appears to be in their case an even more distinct
separation as regards size than there is in that of the flesh-spicules;
but here again intermediate forms occur. They are all stout, more or
less blunt, and more or less regularly covered with very short spines;
most of them are distinctly curved, but some are quite straight.</p>

<p><i>Gemmules.</i> The gemmules are firmly adherent to the support of
the sponge, at the base of which they are congregated in groups of four
or more. They vary considerably in size and shape, many of them being
asymmetrical and some elongate and sausage-shaped. The latter consist of
single gemmules and not of a pair in one case. Extreme forms measure
0.38 × 0.29 and 0.55 × 0.25. Each gemmule is covered with a thick
chitinous membrane in close contact with its wall and surrounding it
completely. This membrane is full of spicules arranged as in a mosaic;
most or all of them belong to the smaller type, and as a rule they are
fairly uniform in size. Separated from this layer by a considerable
interval is another layer of spicules embedded in a chitinous membrane
which is in continuity with the basal membrane of the sponge. The
spicules in this membrane mostly belong to the larger type and are very
variable in size; mingled with them are often a certain number of
birotulate flesh-spicules. The membrane is in close contact with a dense
cage of skeleton-spicules arranged parallel to it and bound together by
chitinous substance. The walls of this cage, when they are in contact
with those of the cages of other gemmules, are coterminous with them.
There is a single depressed aperture in the gemmules, as a rule situated
on one of the longer sides.</p>

<p>This sponge is distinguished from <i>C. burmanica</i> not only by
differences in external form, in the proportions of the spicules and the
structure of the skeleton, but also by the peculiar nature of the
armature of the gemmule. The fact that birotulate spicules<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span> are
often found in close association with them, is particularly
noteworthy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Geographical Distribution.</span>&mdash;This
sponge has only been found in the Western Ghats of the Bombay
Presidency. <i>Localities</i>:&mdash;Igatpuri Lake and the R. Godaveri
at Nasik.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Biology.</span>&mdash;There is a remarkable
difference in external form between the specimens taken in Igatpuri and
those from Nasik, and this difference is apparently due directly to
environment. In the lake, the waters of which are free from mud, the
sponges were growing on the lower surface of stones near the edge. They
formed small crusts not more than about 5 cm. (2 inches) in diameter and
of a pale greyish colour. Their surface was flat or undulated gently,
except round the oscula where it was raised into sharply conical
eminences with furrowed sides. The specimens from Nasik, which is about
30 miles from Igatpuri, were attached, together with specimens of
<i>Spongilla cinerea</i> and <i>S. indica</i>, to the sides of a stone
conduit full of very muddy running water. They were black in colour,
formed broad sheets and were markedly corrugated on the surface. Their
oscula were not raised on conical eminences and were altogether most
inconspicuous. The skeleton was also harder than that of sponges from
the lake.</p>

<p>In the lake <i>C. lapidosa</i> was accompanied by the gemmules of
<i>Spongilla bombayensis</i>, but it is interesting that whereas the
latter sponge was entirely in a resting condition, the former was in
full vegetative vigour, a fact which proves, if proof were necessary,
that the similar conditions of environment do not invariably have the
same effect on different species of Spongillidæ.</p>

Potts's <i>Spongilla novæ-terræ</i> from Newfoundland and N. America
cannot belong to this genus although it has similar flesh-spicules, for,
as Weltner has pointed out (<i>op. cit. supra</i> p.&nbsp;126), the
gemmule-spicules are abortive rotulæ. This is shown very clearly in the
figure published by Petr (Rozp. Ceske Ak. Praze, <ins title="changed
from 'Trìda'">Trída</ins>, ii, pl. ii, figs. 27, 28, 1899), who assigns
the species to <i>Heteromeyenia</i>. Weltner places it in
<i>Ephydatia</i>, and it seems to be a connecting link between the two
genera. It has been suggested that it is a hybrid (Traxler, Termes.
Fuzetek, xxi, p.&nbsp;314, 1898).</p>

<p>On more than one occasion I have found in my aquarium in Calcutta
small sponges of a peculiar type which I am unable to refer with
certainty to any of the species described above. Fig. 4, pl. I,
represents one of these sponges. They are never more than about a
quarter of an inch in diameter and never possess more than one osculum.
They are cushion-shaped, colourless and soft. The skeleton-spicules are
smooth, sharply pointed, moderately slender and relatively large. They
are arranged in definite vertical groups, which project through the
dermal membrane, and in irregular transverse formation. Small spherical
gemmules are present but have only a thin chitinous covering without
spicules or foramen.</p>

<p>These sponges probably represent an abnormal form of some well-known
species, possibly of <i>Spongilla carteri</i>. I have seen nothing like
them in natural conditions.</p>

<p class="p2 center">I.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Phylum C&oelig;lenterata and
the Class Hydrozoa.</span></p>

<p>The second of the great groups or phyla into which the metazoa are
divided is the C&oelig;lenterata, in which are included most of the
animals commonly known as zoophytes, and also the corals, sea-anemones
and jelly-fish. These animals are distinguished from the sponges on the
one hand and from the worms, molluscs, arthropods, vertebrates, etc., on
the other by possessing a central cavity (the c&oelig;lenteron or
"hollow inside") the walls of which are the walls of the body and
consist of <i>two</i> layers of cells separated by a structureless, or
apparently structureless, jelly. This cavity has as a main function that
of a digestive cavity.</p>

<p>An ideally simple c&oelig;lenterate would not differ much in general
appearance from an olynthus (p.&nbsp;27), but it would have no pores in the
body-wall and its upper orifice would probably be surrounded by
prolongations of the body-wall in the form of tentacles. There would be
no collar-cells, and the cells of the body generally would have a much
more fixed and definite position and more regular functions than those
of any sponge. The most characteristic of them would be the so-called
cnidoblasts. Each of these cells contains a capsule<a name="fnanchor_AK"
id="fnanchor_AK"></a><a href="#footnote_AK"
class="fnanchor"><sup>[AK]</sup></a> from which a long thread-like body
can be suddenly uncoiled and shot out.</p>

<p>The simplest in structure of the c&oelig;lenterates are those that
constitute the class Hydrozoa. In this class the primitive central
cavity is not divided up by muscular partitions and there is no folding
in of the anterior part of the body to form an &oelig;sophagus or
stomatodæum such as is found in the sea-anemones and coral<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
polyps. In many species and genera the life-history is complex,
illustrating what is called the alternation of generations. That is to
say, only alternate generations attain sexual maturity, those that do so
being produced as buds from a sexless generation, which itself arises
from the fertilized eggs of a previous sexual generation. The sexual
forms as a rule differ considerably in structure from the sexless ones;
many medusæ are the sexual individuals in a life-cycle in which those of
the sexless generation are sedentary.</p>

<p>An excellent general account of the c&oelig;lenterates will be found
in the Cambridge Natural History, vol. i (by Prof. Hickson).</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">STRUCTURE OF HYDRA.</span></p>

<p><i>Hydra</i>, the freshwater polyp, is one of the simplest of the
Hydrozoa both as regards structure and as regards life-history. Indeed,
it differs little as regards structure from the ideally simple
c&oelig;lenterate sketched in a former paragraph, while its descent is
direct from one polyp to another, every generation laying its own eggs<a
name="fnanchor_AL" id="fnanchor_AL"></a><a href="#footnote_AL"
class="fnanchor"><sup>[AL]</sup></a>. The animal may be described as
consisting of the following parts:&mdash;(1) an upright (or potentially
upright) column or body, (2) a circle of contractile tentacles at the
upper extremity of the column, (3) an oral disk or peristome surrounding
the mouth and surrounded by the tentacles, and (4) a basal or aboral
disk at the opposite extremity. The whole animal is soft and naked. The
column, when the animal is at rest, is almost cylindrical in some forms
but in others has the basal part distinctly narrower than the upper
part. It is highly contractile and when contracted sometimes assumes an
annulate appearance; but as a rule the external surface is smooth.</p>

<p>The tentacles vary in number, but are never very numerous. They are
disposed in a single circle round the oral disk and are hollow, each
containing a prolongation of the central cavity of the column. Like the
column but to an even greater degree they are contractile, and in some
forms they are capable of great elongation. They cannot seize any object
between them, but are able to move in all directions.</p>

<p>The disk that surrounds the mouth, which is a circular aperture, is
narrow and can to some extent assume the form of a conical proboscis,
although this feature is never so marked as it is in some hydroids. The
basal disk is even narrower and is not splayed out round the edges.</p>

<p>A section through the body-wall shows it to consist of the three
typical layers of the c&oelig;lenterates, viz., (i) an outer cellular
layer of comparatively small cells, the ectoderm; (ii) an
intermediate,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg
132]</a></span> structureless or apparently structureless layer, the
mesogl&oelig;a or "central jelly"; and (iii) an internal layer or
endoderm consisting of relatively large cells. The cells of the ectoderm
are not homogeneous. Some of them possess at their base narrow and
highly contractile prolongations that exercise the functions of muscles.
Others are gland-cells and secrete mucus; others have round their
margins delicate ramifying prolongations and act as nerve-cells.
Sense-cells, each of which bears on its external surface a minute
projecting bristle, are found in connection with the nerve-cells, and
also nettle-cells of more than one type.</p>

<p>The mesogl&oelig;a is very thin.</p>

<p>The endoderm consists mainly of comparatively large cells with
polygonal bases which can be seen from the external surface of the
column in colourless individuals. Their inner surface is am&oelig;boid
and in certain conditions bears one or more vibratile cilia or
protoplasmic lashes. Nettle-cells are occasionally found in the
endoderm, but apparently do not originate in this layer.</p>

<p>The walls of the tentacles do not differ in general structure from
those of the column, but the cells of the endoderm are smaller and the
nematocysts of the ectoderm more numerous, and there are other minor
differences.</p>

<p>A more detailed account of the anatomy of <i>Hydra</i> will be found
in any biological text-book, for instance in Parker's Elementary
Biology; but it is necessary here to say something more as regards the
nettle-cells, which are of great biological and systematic
importance.</p>

<p>A nettle-cell of the most perfect type and the structures necessary
to it consist of the following parts:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent1a">(1) A true cell (the cnidoblast), which
contains&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent1b">(2) a delicate capsule full of liquid;</p>

<p class="indent1b">(3) a long thread coiled up in the capsule;
and</p>

<p class="indent1c">(4) a cnidocil or sensory bristle, which
projects from the external surface of the cnidoblast.</p>

<p>A nerve-cell is associated with each cnidoblast.</p>

<p>In <i>Hydra</i> the nettle-cells are of two distinct types, in one of
which the thread is barbed at the base, whereas in the other it is
simple. Both types have often two or more varieties and intermediate
forms occur, but generally speaking the capsules with simple threads are
much smaller than those with barbed ones. The arrangement of the
nettle-cells is not the same in all species of <i>Hydra</i>, but as a
rule they are much more numerous in the tentacles than elsewhere on the
body, each large cell being surrounded by several small ones. The latter
are always much more numerous than the former.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133"
id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span><span class="smcap">Capture and
Ingestion of Prey: Digestion.</span></p>

<p>The usual food of <i>Hydra</i> consists of small insect larvæ, worms,
and crustacea, but the eggs of fish are also devoured. The method in
which prey is captured and ingested has been much disputed, but the
following facts appear to be well established.</p>

<p>If a small animal comes in contact with the tentacles of the polyp,
it instantly becomes paralysed. If it adheres to the tentacle, it
perishes; but if, as is often the case, it does not do so, it soon
recovers the power of movement. Animals which do not adhere are
generally those (such as ostracod crustacea) which have a hard
integument without weak spots. Nematocysts of both kinds shoot out their
threads against prey with considerable violence, the discharge being
effected, apparently in response to a chemical stimulus, by the sudden
uncoiling of the thread and its eversion from the capsule. Apparently
the two kinds of threads have different functions to perform, for
whereas there is no doubt that the barbed threads penetrate the more
tender parts of the body against which they are hurled, there is
evidence that the simple threads do not do so but wrap themselves round
the more slender parts. Nussbaum (Arch. mikr. Anat. xxix, pl. xx, fig.
108) figures the tail of a <i>Cyclops</i> attacked by <i>Hydra
vulgaris</i> and shows several simple threads wrapped round the hairs
and a single barbed thread that has penetrated the integument. Sometimes
the cyst adheres to the thread and remains attached to its cnidoblast
and to the polyp, but sometimes the thread breaks loose. Owing to the
large mass of threads that sometimes congregate at the weaker spots in
the external covering of an animal attacked (<i>e.&nbsp;g.</i>, at the
little sensory pits in the integument of the dorsal surface of certain
water-mites) it is often difficult to trace out the whole length of any
one thread, and as a thread still attached to its capsule is frequently
buried in the body of the prey, right up to the barbs, while another
thread that has broken loose from its capsule appears immediately behind
the fixed one, it seems as though the barbs, which naturally point
towards the capsule, had become reversed. This appearance, however, is
deceptive. The barbs are probably connected with the discharge of the
thread and do not function at all in the same way as those on a spear-
or arrow-head, never penetrating the object against which the projectile
is hurled. Indeed, their position as regards the thread resembles that
of the feathers on the shaft of an arrow rather than that of the barb of
the head.</p>

<p>Adhesion between the tentacles and the prey is effected partly by the
gummy secretion of the glands of the ectoderm, which is perhaps
poisonous as well as adhesive, and partly by the threads. Once the prey
is fast and has ceased to struggle, it is brought to the mouth, which
opens wide to receive it, by the contraction and the contortions of the
tentacles, the column, and the peristome. At the same time a mass of
transparent mucus from the gastral cavity envelops it and assists in
dragging it in. There is some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134"
id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> dispute as to the part played by the
tentacles in conveying food into the mouth. My own observations lead me
to think that, at any rate so far as <i>H. vulgaris</i> is concerned,
they do not push it in, but sometimes in their contortions they even
enter the cavity accidentally.</p>

<p>When the food has once been engulfed some digestive fluid is
apparently poured out upon it. In <i>H. vulgaris</i> it is retained in
the upper part of the cavity and the soluble parts are here dissolved
out, the insoluble parts such as the chitin of insect larvæ or crustacea
being ejected from the mouth. Digestion is, however, to a considerable
extent intracellular, for the cells of the endoderm have the power of
thrusting out from their surface lobular masses of their cell-substance
in which minute nutritive particles are enveloped and dissolved. The
movements of the cilia which can also be thrust out from and retracted
into these cells, keep the food in the gastral cavity in motion and
probably turn it round so as to expose all parts in turn to digestive
action. Complete digestion, at any rate in the Calcutta form, takes
several days to accomplish, and after the process is finished a
flocculent mass of colourless excreta is emitted from the mouth.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Colour.</span></p>

<p>In <i>Hydra viridis</i>, a species that has not yet been found in
India, the green colour is due to the presence in the cells of green
corpuscles which closely resemble those of the cells of certain
freshwater sponges. They represent a stage in the life-cycle of
<i>Chlorella vulgaris</i>, Beyerinck<a name="fnanchor_AM"
id="fnanchor_AM"></a><a href="#footnote_AM"
class="fnanchor"><sup>[AM]</sup></a>, an alga which has been cultivated
independently.</p>

<p>In other species of the genus colour is largely dependent on food,
although minute corpuscles of a <i>dark</i> green shade are sometimes
found in the cells of <i>H. oligactis</i>. In the Calcutta phase of
<i>H. vulgaris</i> colour is due entirely to amorphous particles
situated mainly in the cells of the endoderm. If the polyp is starved or
exposed to a high temperature, these particles disappear and it becomes
practically colourless. They probably form, therefore, some kind of
food-reserve, and it is noteworthy that a polyp kept in the unnatural
conditions that prevail in a small aquarium invariably becomes pale, and
that its excreta are not white and flocculent but contain dark granules
apparently identical with those found in the cells of coloured
individuals (p.&nbsp;154).</p>

<p>Berninger<a name="fnanchor_AN" id="fnanchor_AN"></a><a
href="#footnote_AN" class="fnanchor"><sup>[AN]</sup></a> has just
published observations on the effect of long-continued starvation on
<i>Hydra</i> carried out in Germany. He finds that the tentacles, mouth,
and central jelly disappear, and that a closed "bladder" consisting of
two cellular layers remains; but, to judge from his figures, the colour
does not disappear in these circumstances.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135"
id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span><span class="smcap">Behaviour.</span></p>

<p><i>Hydra viridis</i> is a more sluggish animal than the other species
of its genus and does not possess the same power of elongating its
column and tentacles. It is, nevertheless, obliged to feed more
frequently. Wagner (Quart. J. Micr. Sci. xlviii, p.&nbsp;586, 1905) found it
impossible to use this species in his physiological experiments because
it died of starvation more rapidly than other forms. This fact is
interesting in view of the theory that the green corpuscles in the cells
of <i>H. viridis</i> elaborate nutritive substances for its benefit.
<i>H. vulgaris</i>, at any rate in Calcutta, does not ordinarily capture
prey more often than about once in three days.</p>

<p>All <i>Hydræ</i> (except possibly the problematical <i>H. rubra</i>
of Roux, p.&nbsp;160) spend the greater part of their time attached by
the basal disk to some solid object, but, especially in early life,
<i>H. vulgaris</i> is often found floating free in the water, and all
the species possess powers of progression. They do not, however, all
move in the same way. <i>H. viridis</i> progresses by "looping" like a
geometrid caterpillar. During each forward movement the column is arched
downwards so that the peristome is in contact with the surface along
which the animal is moving. The basal disk is then detached and the
column is twisted round until the basal disk again comes in contact with
the surface at a point some distance in advance of its previous point of
attachment. The man&oelig;uvre is then repeated. <i>H. vulgaris</i>,
when about to move, bends down its column so that it lies almost prone,
stretches out its tentacles, which adhere near the tips to the surface
(p.&nbsp;153), detaches its basal disk, and then contracts the
tentacles. The column is dragged forward, still lying almost prone, the
basal disk is bent downwards and again attached, and the whole movement
is repeated. Probably <i>H. oligactis</i> moves in the same way.</p>

<p>When <i>H. viridis</i> is at rest the tentacles and column, according
to Wagner, exhibit rhythmical contractions in which those of the buds
act in sympathy with those of the parent. In <i>H. vulgaris</i> no such
movements have been observed. This species, however, when it is waiting
for prey (p.&nbsp;154) changes the direction of its tentacles about once in
half an hour.</p>

<p>All species of <i>Hydra</i> react to chemical and physical stimuli by
contraction and by movements of the column and tentacles, but if the
stimuli are constantly repeated, they lose the power to some extent. All
species are attracted by light and move towards the point whence it
reaches them. <i>H. vulgaris</i>, however, at any rate in India, is more
strongly repelled by heat. Consequently, if it is placed in a glass
vessel of water, on one side of which the sun is shining directly, it
moves away from the source of the light<a name="fnanchor_AO"
id="fnanchor_AO"></a><a href="#footnote_AO"
class="fnanchor"><sup>[AO]</sup></a>. But if the vessel be
protected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg
136]</a></span> from the direct rays of the sun and only a subdued light
falls on one side of it, the polyp moves towards that side. No species
of the genus is able to move in a straight line. Wilson (Amer. Natural.
xxv, p.&nbsp;426, 1891) and Wagner (<i>op. cit. supra</i>) have published
charts showing the elaborately erratic course pursued by a polyp in
moving from one point to another and the effect of light as regards its
movements.</p>

<p>If an individual of <i>H. vulgaris</i> that contains half digested
food in its gastral cavity is violently removed from its natural
surroundings and placed in a glass of water, the column and tentacles
contract strongly for a few minutes. The body then becomes greatly
elongated and the tentacles moderately so; the tentacles writhe in all
directions (their tips being sometimes thrust into the mouth), and the
food is ejected.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Reproduction.</span></p>

<p>Reproduction takes place in <i>Hydra</i> (i) by means of buds, (ii)
by means of eggs, and (iii) occasionally by fission.</p>

<p class="p2 center">(a) <i>Sexual Reproduction.</i></p>

<p>The sexual organs consist of ovaries (female) and spermaries (male).
Sometimes the two kinds of organs are borne by the same individual
either simultaneously or in succession, but some individuals or races
appear to be exclusively of one sex. There is much evidence that in
unfavourable conditions the larger proportion of individuals develop
only male organs.</p>

<p>In temperate climates most forms of <i>Hydra</i> breed at the
approach of winter, but starvation undoubtedly induces a precocious
sexual activity, and the same is probably the case as regards other
unfavourable conditions such as lack of oxygen in the water and either
too high or too low a temperature.</p>

<p>Downing states that in N. America (Chicago) <i>H. vulgaris</i> breeds
in spring and sometimes as late as December; in Calcutta it has only
been found breeding in February and March. Except during the
breeding-season sexual organs are absent; they do not appear in the same
position on the column in all species.</p>

<p>The spermaries take the form of small mound-shaped projections on the
surface of the column. Each consists of a mass of sperm-mother cells, in
which the spermatozoa originate in large numbers. The spermatozoa
resemble those of other animals, each possessing a head, which is shaped
like an acorn, and a long vibratile tail by means of which it moves
through the water. In the cells of the spermary the spermatozoa are
closely packed together, with their heads pointing outwards towards the
summit of the mound through which they finally make their way into the
water. The aperture is formed by their own movements. Downing (Zool.
Jahrb. (Anat.) xxi, p.&nbsp;379, 1905) and other authors have studied the
origin of the spermatozoa in great detail.</p>

section through egg of <i>H. oligactis</i>, form A (after Brauer).
C=vertical section through egg of <i>H. oligactis</i>, form B (after
Brauer).</p>

<p>The ovaries consist of rounded masses of cells lying at the base of
the ectoderm. One of these cells, the future egg, grows more rapidly
than the others, some or all of which it finally absorbs by means of
lobose pseudopodia extruded from its margin. It then makes its way by
am&oelig;boid movements between the cells of the ectoderm until it
reaches the surface. In <i>H. vulgaris</i> (Mem. Asiat. Soc. Beng. i, p.
350, 1906) the egg is first visible with the aid of a lens as a minute
star-shaped body of an intense white colour lying at the base of the
ectoderm cells. It increases in size rapidly, gradually draws in its
pseudopodia (the rays of the star) and makes its way through the
ectoderm to the exterior. The process occupies not more than two hours.
The issuing ovum does not destroy the ectoderm cells as it passes out,
but squeezes them together round the aperture it makes. Owing to the
pressure it exerts upon them, they become much elongated and form a cup,
in which the embryo rests on the surface of the parent. By the time that
the egg has become globular, organic connection has ceased to exist. The
embryo is held in position partly by means of the cup of elongated
ectoderm cells and partly by a delicate film of mucus secreted by the
parent. The most recent account of the oogenesis ("ovogenesis") is by
Downing (Zool. Jahrb. (Anat.) xxvii, p.&nbsp;295, 1909).</p>

<p class="p2 center">(b) <i>Budding.</i></p>

<p>The buds of <i>Hydra</i> arise as hollow outgrowths from the wall of
the column, probably in a definite order and position in each species.
The tentacles are formed on the buds much as the buds themselves arise
on the column. There is much dispute as to the order in which these
structures appear on the bud, and Haacke (Jenaische Zeitschr. Naturwiss.
xiv, p.&nbsp;133, 1880) has proposed to distinguish two species, <i>H.
trembleyi</i> and <i>H. r&oelig;selii</i>, in accordance with the manner
in which the phenomenon is manifested.<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> It seems probable,
however, that the number of tentacles that are developed in the first
instance is due, at any rate to some extent, to circumstances, for in
the summer brood of <i>H. vulgaris</i> in Calcutta five usually appear
simultaneously, while in the winter brood of the same form four as a
rule do so. Sometimes buds remain attached to their parents sufficiently
long to develop buds themselves, so that temporary colonies of some
complexity arise, but I have not known this to occur in the case of
Indian individuals.</p>

<p class="p2 center">(c) <i>Fission.</i></p>

<p>Reproduction by fission occurs naturally but not habitually in all
species of <i>Hydra</i>. It may take place either by a horizontal or by
a vertical division of the column. In the latter case it may be either
equal or unequal. If equal, it usually commences by an elongation in one
direction of the circumoral disk, which assumes a narrowly oval form;
the tentacles increase in number, and a notch appears at either side of
the disk and finally separates the column into two equal halves, each of
which is a complete polyp. The division sometimes commences at the base
of the column, but this is very rare. Transverse fission can be induced
artificially and is said to occur sometimes in natural conditions. It
commences by a constriction of the column which finally separates the
animal into two parts, the lower of which develops tentacles and a
mouth, while the upper part develops a basal disk. Unequal vertical
division occurs when the column is divided vertically in such a way that
the two resulting polyps are unequal in size. It is apparently not
accompanied by any great increase in the number of the tentacles, but
probably starts by one of the tentacles becoming forked and finally
splitting down the middle.</p>

<p>The question of the regeneration of lost parts in <i>Hydra</i> cannot
well be separated from that of reproduction by fission. Over a hundred
and fifty years ago Trembley found that if a polyp were cut into several
pieces, each piece produced those structures necessary to render it a
perfect polyp. He also believed that he had induced a polyp that had
been turned inside out to adapt itself to circumstances and to reverse
the functions and structure of the two cellular layers of its body. In
this, however, he was probably mistaken, for there can be little doubt
that his polyp turned right side out while not under his immediate
observation. Many investigators have repeated some of his other
experiments with success in Europe, but the Calcutta <i>Hydra</i> is too
delicate an animal to survive vivisection and invariably dies if
lacerated. It appears that, even in favourable circumstances, for a
fresh polyp to be formed by artificial fission it is necessary for the
piece to contain cells of both cell-layers.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139"
id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span><span class="smcap">Development of the
Egg.</span></p>

<p>The egg of <i>Hydra</i> is said to be fertilized as it lies at the
base of the ectoderm, through which the fertilizing spermatozoon bores
its way. As soon as the egg has emerged from the cells of its parent it
begins to split up in such a manner as to form a hollow mass of
comparatively large equal cells. Smaller cells are separated off from
these and soon fill the central cavity. Before segmentation begins a
delicate film of mucus is secreted over the egg, and within this film
the larger cells secrete first a thick chitinous or horny egg-shell and
within it a delicate membrane. Development in some cases is delayed for
a considerable period, but sooner or later, by repeated division of the
cells, an oval hollow embryo is formed and escapes into the water by the
disintegration of the egg-shell and the subsequent rupture of the inner
membrane. Tentacles soon sprout out from one end of the embryo's body
and a mouth is formed; the column becomes more slender and attaches
itself by the aboral pole to some solid object.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Enemies.</span></p>

<p><i>Hydra</i> seems to have few natural enemies. Martin (Q. J. Micr.
Sci. London, lii, p.&nbsp;261, 1908) has, however, described how the
minute worm <i>Microstoma lineare</i> attacks <i>Hydra "rubra"</i> in
Scottish lochs, while the larva of a midge devours <i>H. vulgaris</i> in
considerable numbers in Calcutta tanks (p.&nbsp;156).</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">C&oelig;lenterates of Brackish
Water.</span></p>

<p>Marine c&oelig;lenterates of different orders not infrequently make
their way or are carried by the tide up the estuaries of rivers into
brackish water, and several species have been found living in isolated
lagoons and pools of which the water was distinctly salt or brackish.
Among the most remarkable instances of such isolation is the occurrence
in Lake Qurun in the Fayûm of Egypt of <i>Cordylophora lacustris</i> and
of the peculiar little hydroid recently described by Mr. C. L. Boulenger
as <i>M&oelig;risia lyonsi</i> (Q. J. Micr. Sci. London, lii, p.&nbsp;357,
pls. xxii, xxiii, 1908). In the delta of the Ganges there are numerous
ponds which have at one time been connected with estuaries or creeks of
brackish water and have become isolated either naturally or by the hand
of man without the marine element in their fauna by any means
disappearing (p.&nbsp;14). The following species have been found in such
ponds:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">(<i>a</i>) <i>Hydrozoa.</i></p>

<p>(1) <i>Bimeria vestita</i>, Wright (1859).</p>

<div class="genus">
<span class="i0">Hincks, Hist. Brit. Hydr. Zooph. p.&nbsp;103, pl. xv,
fig. 2 (1868); Annandale, Rec. Ind. Mus. i, p.&nbsp;141, fig. 3
(1907).</span>
</div>

<p>This is a European species which has also been found off<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> S.
America. It occurs not uncommonly in the creeks that penetrate into the
Ganges delta and has been found in pools of brackish water at Port
Canning. The Indian form is perhaps sufficiently distinct to be regarded
as a subspecies. The medusoid generation is suppressed in this
genus.</p>

<p class="p2">(2) <i>Syncoryne filamentata</i>, Annandale (1907).</p>

<div class="genus">
<span class="i0">Annandale, Rec. Ind. Mus. i, p.&nbsp;139, figs. 1, 2
(1907).</span>
</div>

<p>Both hydroid and medusæ were found in a small pool of brackish water
at Port Canning. The specific name refers to the fact that the ends of
the rhizomes from which the polyps arise are frequently free and
elongate, for the young polyp at the tip apparently takes some time to
assume its adult form.</p>

<p class="p2">(3) <i>Irene ceylonensis</i>, Browne (1905).</p>

<div class="genus">
<span class="i0">Browne, in Herdman's Report on the Pearl Fisheries of
Ceylon, iv, p.&nbsp;140, pl. iii, figs. 9-11 (1905); Annandale, Rec. Ind.
Mus. i, p.&nbsp;142, fig. 4 (1907).</span>
</div>

<p>The medusa was originally taken off the coast of Ceylon, while the
hydroid was discovered in ponds of brackish water at Port Canning. It is
almost microscopic in size.</p>

<p>The first two of these species belong to the order Gymnoblastea
(Anthomedusæ) and the third to the Calyptoblastea (Leptomedusæ).</p>

<p class="p2 center">(b) <i>Actinozoa.</i></p>

<p>(4) <i>Sagartia schilleriana</i>, Stoliczka (1869).</p>

<div class="genus">

<span class="i0"><i>S. schilleriana</i>, Stoliczka, Journ. As. Soc.
Beng. (2) xxxviii, p.&nbsp;28, pls. x, xi (1869); <i>Metridium
schillerianum</i>, Annandale, Rec. Ind. Mus. i, p.&nbsp;47, pl. iii
(1907).</span>

</div>

<p>This sea-anemone, which has only been found in the delta of the
Ganges, offers a most remarkable instance of what appears to be rapid
adaptation of a species to its environment. The typical form, which was
described in 1869 by Stoliczka from specimens taken in tidal creeks and
estuaries in the Gangetic area and in the ponds at Port Canning, is
found attached to solid objects by its basal disk. The race (subsp.
<i>exul</i>), however, that is now found in the same ponds has become
elongate in form and has adopted a burrowing habit, apparently owing to
the fact that the bottom of the ponds in which it lives is soft and
muddy.</p>

<p>In addition to these four species a minute hydroid belonging to the
order Gymnoblastea and now being described by Mr. J. Ritchie has been
taken in the ponds at Port Canning. It is a very aberrant form.</p>

C&oelig;lenterates other than Hydra.</span></p>

<p><i>Hydra</i> is the only genus of c&oelig;lenterates as yet found in
fresh water in India, but several others have been discovered in other
countries. They are:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) <i>Cordylophora lacustris</i>, Allman (1843).</p>

<div class="genus">
<span class="i0">Hincks, Hist. Brit. Hydr. Zooph. p.&nbsp;16, pl. iii,
fig. 2 (1868).</span>
</div>

<p>This is a branching hydroid that does not produce free medusæ. It
forms bushy masses somewhat resembling those formed by a luxuriant
growth of <i>Plumatella fruticosa</i> (pl. iii, fig. 1) in general
appearance. <i>C. lacustris</i> is abundant in canals, rivers, and
estuaries in many parts of Europe and has recently been found in the
isolated salt lake Birket-el-Qurun in the Fayûm of Egypt.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Cordylophora whiteleggei</i>, v. Lendenfeld (1887).</p>

<div class="genus">
<span class="i0">Zool. Jahrb. ii, p.&nbsp;97 (1887).</span>
</div>

<p>A species or race of much feebler growth; as yet imperfectly known
and only recorded from fresh water in Australia.</p>

<p><i>Cordylophora</i> is a normal genus of the class Hydrozoa and the
order Gymnoblastea; the next four genera are certainly Hydrozoa, but
their affinities are very doubtful.</p>

<p> (3) <i>Microhydra ryderi</i>, Potts (1885).</p>

<div class="genus">
<span class="i0">Potts, Q. J. Micr. Sci. London, l, p.&nbsp;623, pls.
xxxv, xxxvi; Browne, <i>ibid.</i> p.&nbsp;635, pl. xxxvii (1906).</span>
</div>

<p>This animal, which has been found in N. America and in Germany,
possesses both an asexual hydroid and a sexual medusoid generation. The
former reproduces its species by direct budding as well as by giving
rise, also by a form of budding, to medusæ that become sexually mature.
The hydroid has no tentacles.</p>

<p>(4) <i>Limnocodium sowerbii</i>, Lankester (1880).</p>

<div class="genus">

</div>

<p>There is some doubt as to the different stages in the life-cycle of
this species. The medusa has been found in tanks in hot-houses in
England, France and Germany, and a minute hydroid closely resembling
that of <i>Microhydra ryderi</i> has been associated with it
provisionally.</p>

<p>Two stages in this peculiar hydroid, which is found in the R. Volga,
are known, (<i>a</i>) a spiral ribbon-like form parasitic on the eggs of
the sterlet (<i>Acipenser ruthenus</i>), and (<i>b</i>) a small

Similar capsules are found in the tissues of certain worms and molluscs,
but there is the strongest evidence that these animals, which habitually
devour c&oelig;lenterates, are able to swallow the capsules uninjured
and to use them as weapons of defence (see Martin, Q. J. Micro. Sci.
London, lii, p.&nbsp;261, 1908, and Grosvenor, Proc. Roy. Soc. London,
lxxii, p.&nbsp;462, 1903). The "trichocysts" of certain protozoa bear a
certain resemblance to the nettle-cells of c&oelig;lenterates and
probably have similar functions.</p>

The statement is not strictly accurate as regards the Calcutta phase of
<i>H. vulgaris</i>, for the summer brood apparently does not lay eggs
but reproduces its species by means of buds only. This state of affairs,
however, is probably an abnormality directly due to environment.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">History of the Study of
Hydra.</span></p>

<p>Hydra was discovered by Leeuwenhoek at the beginning of the
eighteenth century and had attracted the attention of several skilful
and accurate observers before that century was half accomplished. Among
them the chief was Trembley, whose "Mémoires pour servir à l'histoire
d'un genre de Polype d'eau douce"* was published at Paris 1744, and is
remarkable not only for the extent and accuracy of the observations it
enshrines but also for the beauty of its plates. Baker in his work
entitled "An attempt towards a natural history of the Polyp"* (London,
1743) and Rösel von Rosenhof in the third part of his
"Insecten-Belustigung" (Nurenberg, 1755) also made important
contributions to the study of the physiology and structure of
<i>Hydra</i> about the same period. Linné invented the name
<i>Hydra</i>, and in his "Fauna Sueica" and in the various editions of
his "Systema Naturæ" described several forms in a manner that permits
some of them to be recognized; but Linné did not distinguish between the
true <i>Hydra</i> and other soft sessile C&oelig;lenterates, and it is
to Pallas ("Elenchus Zoophytorum," 1766) that the credit properly
belongs of reducing the genus to order. It is a tribute to his insight
that three of the four species he described are still accepted as "good"
by practically all students of the C&oelig;lenterates, while the fourth
was a form that he had not himself seen.</p>

<p>In the nineteenth century the freshwater polyp became a favourite
object of biological observation and was watched and examined by a host
of observers, among the more noteworthy of whom were Kleinenberg,
Nussbaum, and Brauer, who has since the beginning of the present century
made an important contribution to the taxonomy of the genus.</p>

<p><i>Hydra</i> has been examined by thousands of students in biological
laboratories all over the civilized world, and the literature upon it is
hardly surpassed in magnitude by that on any other genus but

general memoirs and of the papers that refer directly to Asiatic
material. A systematic bibliography is given by Bedot in his "Matériaux

<p class="captionj">A=winter brood; B=summer brood, the same individual
in an expanded and a contracted condition. B is more highly magnified
than A.</p>

<p><i>Column</i> slender and capable of great elongation, normally
almost cylindrical, but when containing food often shaped like a
wine-glass. The surface is thickly set with nettle-cells the cnidocils
of which give it an almost hirsute appearance under the<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
microscope. When extended to the utmost the column is sometimes nearly
30 mm. (1-1/5 inches) long, but more commonly it is about half that
length or even shorter.</p>

<p><i>Tentacles</i> usually 4-6, occasionally 8. They are always slender
except when they are contracted, then becoming swollen at the base and
slightly globular at the tip. If the animal is at rest they are not very
much longer than the body, but if it is hungry or about to move from one
place to another they are capable of very great extension, often
becoming like a string of minute beads (the groups of nettle-cells)
strung on an invisible wire.</p>

<p><i>Nettle-cells.</i> The capsules with barbed threads (fig. 27, p.
131) are very variable in size, but they are invariably broad in
proportion to their length and as a rule nearly spherical. In a
<i>Hydra</i> taken in Calcutta during the winter the largest capsules
measured (unexploded) 0.0189 mm. in breadth and 0.019 in length, but in
summer they are smaller (about 0.012 mm. in breadth). Smaller capsules
with barbed threads always occur. The barbed threads are very long and
slender. At their base they bear a circle of stout and prominent spines,
usually 4 in number; above these there are a number of very small
spines, but the small spines are usually obscure. Malformed corpuscles
are common. The capsules with unbarbed threads are very nearly as broad
at the distal as at the proximal end; they are broadly oval with rounded
ends.</p>

<p><i>Reproductive organs.</i> The reproductive organs are confined to
the upper part of the body. In India eggs (fig. 28, p.&nbsp;137) are
seldom produced. They sometimes appear, however, at the beginning of the
hot weather. In form they are spherical, and their shell bears
relatively long spines, which are expanded, flattened and more or less
divided at the tip. The part of the egg that is in contact with the
parent-polyp is bare. Spermaries are produced more readily than ovaries;
they are mammillate in form and number from 4 to 24. Ovaries and
spermaries have not been found on the same individual.</p>

<p><i>Buds</i> are confined to a narrow zone nearer the base than the
apex of the column. Rarely more than 2 are produced at a time, and I
have never seen an attached bud budding. In winter 5 tentacles are as a
rule produced simultaneously, and in summer 4. In the former case a
fifth often makes its appearance before the bud is liberated.</p>

<p>In Calcutta two broods can be distinguished, a cold-weather brood,
which is larger, stouter, and more deeply coloured, produces buds more
freely, has larger nematocysts, and as a rule possesses 6 tentacles; and
a hot-weather brood, which is smaller, more slender and paler, produces
buds very sparingly, has smaller nematocysts, and as a rule possesses
only 4 or 5 tentacles. Only the cold-weather form is known to become
sexually mature. There is evidence, however, that in those parts of
India which enjoy a more uniform tropical climate than Lower Bengal,
polyps found at all times of year resemble those found in the hot
weather in Calcutta, and sometimes produce spermatozoa or eggs.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg
151]</a></span>I have recently had an opportunity of comparing specimens
of the Calcutta hot-weather form with well-preserved examples of <i>H.
vulgaris</i>, Pallas (=<i>H. grisea</i>, Linn.), from England. They
differ from these polyps in very much the same way as, but to a greater
degree than they do from the winter phase of their own race, and I have
therefore no doubt that <i>H. orientalis</i> is merely a tropical phase
of Pallas's species. My description is based on Indian specimens, which
seem to differ, so far as anatomy is concerned, from European ones in
the following points:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent1a">(1) The sexes are invariably distinct;</p>
<p class="indent1c">(2) the nematocysts are invariably smaller.</p>

<p>I have seen in Burma an abnormal individual with no tentacles. <ins
title="changed from 'It'">Its</ins> buds, however, possessed these
organs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Type.</span> None of the older types of
<i>Hydra</i> are now in existence. That of <i>H. orientalis</i> is,
however, in the collection of the Indian Museum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Geographical Distribution.</span>&mdash;<i>H.
vulgaris</i> is common in Europe and N. America and is probably found
all over tropical Asia. The following are Indian and Ceylon
localities:&mdash;<span class="smcap">Bengal</span>, Calcutta and
neighbourhood (<i>Annandale</i>, <i>Lloyd</i>); Adra, Manbhum district
(<i>Paiva</i>), Rampur Bhulia on the R. Ganges (<i>Annandale</i>);
Chakradharpur, Chota Nagpur (<i>Annandale</i>); Pusa, Bihar
(<i>Annandale</i>); Puri, Orissa (<i>Annandale</i>): <span
class="smcap">Madras</span>, sea-beach near Madras town
(<i>Henderson</i>): <span class="smcap">Bombay</span>, island of Bombay
(<i>Powell</i>): <span class="smcap">Burma</span>, Mandalay, Upper
Burma, and Moulmein, N. Tenasserim (<i>Annandale</i>): <span
class="smcap">Ceylon</span>, Colombo and Peradeniya (<i>Willey</i>,
<i>Green</i>). Dr. A. D. Imms tells me that he has obtained specimens
that probably belong to this species in the Jumna at Allahabad.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Biology.</span>&mdash;In India <i>H. vulgaris</i>
is usually found, so far as my experience goes, in stagnant water. In
Calcutta it is most abundant in ponds containing plenty of aquatic
vegetation, and seems to be especially partial to the plant
<i>Limnanthemum</i>, which has floating leaves attached to thin stalks
that spring up from the bottom, and to <i>Lemna</i> (duckweed). Dr.
Henderson, however, found specimens in a pool of rain-water on the
sea-shore near Madras.</p>

<p>There is evidence that each of the two broods which occur in Lower
Bengal represents at least one generation; probably it represents more
than one, for tentacles are rarely if ever produced after the animal has
obtained its full size, and never (or only owing to accident) decrease
in number after they have once appeared. The winter form is found
chiefly near the surface of the water, especially on the roots of
duckweed and on the lower surface of the leaves of <i>Limnanthemum</i>;
but the summer form affects deeper water in shady places, and as a rule
attaches itself to wholly submerged plants. The latter form is to be met
with between March and October, the cold-weather form between October
and March, both being sometimes found together at the periods of
transition. In the unnatural environment of an aquarium, however,
individuals of the winter form lose their colour and become attenuated,
in these features resembling the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152"
id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span> summer form, even in the cooler
months. Buds produced in these conditions rarely have more than five
tentacles or themselves produce buds freely after liberation.</p>

<p>The buds appear in a fixed order and position, at any rate on
individuals examined in winter; in specimens of the summer form the
position is fixed, but the order is irregular. Each quadrant of the
column has apparently the power of producing, in a definite zone nearer
the aboral pole than the mouth, a single bud; but the buds of the
different quadrants are not produced simultaneously. If we imagine that
the quadrants face north, south, east, and west, and that the first bud
is produced in the north quadrant, the second will be produced in the
east quadrant, the third in the south, and the fourth in the west. It is
doubtful whether more than four buds are produced in the lifetime of an
individual, and apparently attached buds never bud in this race. The
second bud usually appears before the first is liberated, and this is
also the case occasionally as regards the third, but it is exceptional
for four buds to be present at one time. About three weeks usually
elapse between the date at which the bud first appears as a minute
conical projection on the surface of the parent and that at which it
liberates itself. This it does by bending down, fixing itself to some
solid object by means of the tips of its tentacles, the gland-cells of
which secrete a gummy fluid, and then tearing itself free.</p>

<p>Although it is rare for more than two buds to be produced
simultaneously, budding is apparently a more usual form of reproduction
than sexual reproduction. Individuals that bear eggs have not yet been
found in India in natural conditions, although males with functional
spermaries are not uncommon at the approach of the hot weather. The few
eggs that I have seen were produced in my aquarium towards the end of
the cold weather. Starvation, lack of oxygen, and too high a temperature
(perhaps also lack of light) appear to stimulate the growth of the male
organs in ordinary cases, but perhaps they induce the development of
ovaries in the case of individuals that are unusually well
nourished.</p>

<p>The spines that cover the egg retain débris of various kinds upon its
surface, so that it becomes more or less completely concealed by a
covering of fragments of dead leaves and the like even before it is
separated from the polyp. Its separation is brought about by its falling
off the column of the parent. Nothing is known of its subsequent fate,
but probably it lies dormant in the mud through the hot weather. Eggs
are sometimes produced that have no shells. This is probably due to the
fact that they have not been fertilized.</p>

<p>Reproduction by fission occurs rarely in the Indian <i>Hydra</i>, but
both equal and unequal vertical fission have been observed. In the case
of equal fission the circumoral area lengthens in a horizontal
direction, and as many extra tentacles as those the polyp already
possesses make their appearance. The mouth then becomes constricted in
the middle and notches corresponding to its constriction appear at
either side of the upper part of the column. Finally the<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
whole animal divides into two equal halves in a vertical direction. I
have only seen one instance of what appeared to be unequal vertical
fission&mdash;that of a polyp consisting of two individuals still joined
together by the basal disk, but one about half the size of the other.
Each had three well-developed tentacles, and in addition a minute fourth
tentacle. This was situated on the side opposed to that of the other
individual which bore a similar tentacle. Transverse fission has not
been observed. The Indian <i>Hydra</i> is a very delicate animal as
compared with such a form as <i>H. viridis</i>, and all attempts to
produce artificial fission without killing the polyp have as yet
failed.</p>

<p>Young individuals are often, and adults occasionally, found floating
free in the water, either with the mouth uppermost and the tentacles
extended so as to cover as large an area as possible or with the aboral
pole at the surface. In the former case they float in mid-water, being
of nearly the same specific gravity as the water, and are carried about
by any movement set up in it. In the latter case, however, the base of
the column is actually attached to some small object such as the cast
skin of a water-flea or to a minute drop of mucus originally given out
by the polyp's own mouth; the tentacles either hang downwards or are
spread out round the mouth, and the animal is carried about by wind or
other agencies acting on the surface.</p>

<p>In addition to this passive method of progression the polyp can crawl
with considerable rapidity. In doing so it bends its column down to the
object along which it is about to move in such a way that it lies almost
parallel to the surface, the basal disk, however, being still attached.
The tentacles are then extended and attach themselves near the tips to
the surface a considerable distance away. Attachment is effected by the
secretion of minute drops of adhesive substance from gland-cells. The
basal disk is liberated and the tentacles contract, dragging the column,
which still lies prone, along as they do so. The basal disk again
affixes itself, the tentacles wrench themselves free, the surface of
their cells being often drawn out in the process into pseudopodia-like
projections, which of course are not true pseudopodia<a
name="fnanchor_AS" id="fnanchor_AS"></a><a href="#footnote_AS"
class="fnanchor"><sup>[AS]</sup></a> but merely projections produced by
the mechanical strain. The whole action is then repeated. The polyp can
also pull itself across a space such as that between two stems or leaves
by stretching out one of its tentacles, fixing the tip to the object it
desires to reach, pulling itself free from its former point of
attachment, and dragging itself across by contracting the fixed
tentacle. The basal disk is then turned round and fixed to the new
support.</p>

<p>The Indian polyp, like all its congeners, is attracted by light, but
it is more strongly repelled by heat. Probably it never moves in a
straight line, but if direct sunlight falls on one side<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> of
a glass aquarium, the polyps move away from that side in a much less
erratic course than is usually the case. If conditions are favourable,
they often remain in one spot for weeks at a time, their buds
congregating round them as they are set free. In a natural environment
it seems that regular migrations take place in accordance with changes
in temperature, for whereas in cool weather many individuals are found
adhering to the lower surface of the floating leaves of
<i>Limnanthemum</i>, few are found in this position immediately after a
rise in the thermometer. If the rise is only a small one, they merely
crawl down the stems to the end of which the leaves are attached, but as
soon as the hot weather begins in earnest, the few that survive make
their way to the deepest and most shady part of the pond. In captivity
the polyps seek the bottom of any vessel in which they are contained, if
sunlight falls on the surface of the water.</p>

<p>The chief function of the tentacles is that of capturing prey. The
Indian polyp feeds as a rule in the early morning, before the day has
become hot. In an aquarium at any rate, the tentacles are never more
than moderately extended during the night. If the polyp is hungry, they
are extended to their greatest length in the early morning, and if prey
is not captured, they sometimes remain in this condition throughout the
day. In these circumstances they hang down or stand up in the water
closely parallel to one another, and often curved in the middle as if a
current were directed against them. Prey that comes in contact with one
of them has little chance of escape, for nematocysts from all the
tentacles can be readily discharged against it. Approximately once in
half an hour the direction of the tentacles is changed, but I have been
unable to observe any regular rhythmical movements of the tentacles or
any correlation between those of a parent polyp and the buds still
attached to it.</p>

<p>The prey consists chiefly of the young larvæ of midges (Chironomidæ)
and may-flies, but small copepod and phyllopod crustacea are also
captured.</p>

<p>As soon as the prey adheres firmly to the tentacles and has become
paralysed it is brought to the mouth by their contracting strongly and
is involved in a mass of colourless mucus extruded from the digestive
cavity. Partly by the contraction of muscle-fibres in the body-wall and
partly by movements of the mouth itself assisted by the mucus, which
apparently remains attached to the walls of the cavity, the food is
brought into the mouth. If it is at all bulky, it remains in the upper
part of the cavity, the gland-cells pouring out a digestive fluid upon
it and so dissolving out soluble substances. A large share of the
substances thus prepared falls down to the bottom of the cavity and are
there digested by the endoderm cells. The insoluble parts of the food
are, however, ejected from the mouth without ever reaching the base of
the cavity.</p>

<p>The colour of the polyp appears to be due mainly to the results of
digestion. Brown or orange individuals recently captured in<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span> a
pond and kept in favourable conditions take three or four days to digest
their food, and the excreta ejected from the mouth then take the form of
a white flocculent mass. If, however, the same individuals are kept for
long in a glass aquarium, they lose their colour, even though they feed
readily. Digestion is then a much more rapid process, and the excreta
contain minute, irregular, coloured granules, which appear to be
identical with those contained in the endoderm cells of individuals that
have recently digested a meal fully. Starved individuals are always
nearly colourless. It seems, therefore, that in this species colour is
due directly to the products of digestion, and that digestion does not
take place so fully in unfavourable conditions or at a high temperature
as it does in more healthy circumstances. The dark green colour of some
polyps is, however, less easily explained. I have noticed that all the
individuals which have produced eggs in my aquarium have been of this
colour, which they have retained in spite of captivity; whereas
individuals that produced spermatozoa often lost their colour completely
before doing so, sometimes becoming of a milky white owing to the
accumulation of minute drops of liquid in their endoderm cells. Even in
green individuals there is never any trace in the cells of coloured
bodies of a definite form.</p>

<p>The Indian polyp, unlike European representatives of its species, is
a very delicate little animal. In captivity at any rate, three
circumstances are most inimical to its life: firstly, a sudden rise in
the temperature, which may either kill the polyp directly or cause it to
hasten its decease by becoming sexually mature; secondly, the lack of a
free current of air on the surface of the aquarium; and thirdly, the
growth of a bacterium, which forms a scum on the top of the water and
clogs up the interstices between the leaves and stems of the
water-plants, soon killing them. If adult polyps are kept even in a
shallow opaque vessel which is shut up in a room with closed shutters
they generally die in a single night; indeed, they rarely survive for
more than a few days unless the vessel is placed in such a position that
air is moving almost continuously over its surface. The bacterium to
which I allude often almost seals up the aquarium, especially in March
and April, in which months its growth is very rapid. Strands of slime
produced by it surround the polyp and even enter its mouth. In this
event the polyp retracts its tentacles until they become mere
prominences on its disk, and shrinks greatly in size. The colouring
matter in its body becomes broken up into irregular patches owing to
degeneracy of the endoderm cells, and it dies within a few hours.</p>

<p><i>Hydra</i> in Calcutta is often devoured by the larva of a small
midge (<i>Chironomus fasciatipennis</i>, Kieffer) common in the tanks
from November to February. In the early stages of its larval life this
insect wanders free among communities of protozoa (<i>Vorticella</i>,
<i>Epistylis</i>, &amp;c. ) and rotifers on which it feeds, but as
maturity approaches begins to build for itself a temporary shelter of
one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg
156]</a></span> of two kinds, either a delicate silken tunnel the base
of which is formed by some smooth natural surface, or a regular tube the
base of which is fixed by a stalk situated near the middle of its length
to some solid object, while the whole surface is covered with little
projections. The nature of the covering appears to depend partly on that
of the food-supply and partly on whether the larva is about to change
its skin.</p>

<p>I had frequently noticed that tunnels brought from the tank on the
under surface of <i>Limnanthemum</i> leaves had a <i>Hydra</i> fixed to
them. This occurred in about a third of the occupied shelters examined.
The <i>Hydra</i> was always in a contracted condition and often more or
less mutilated. By keeping a larva together with a free polyp in a glass
of clean water, I have been able to observe the manner in which the
polyp is captured and entangled. The larva settles down near the base of
its column and commences to spin a tunnel. When this is partially
completed, it passes a thread round the polyp's body to which it gives a
sharp bite. This causes the polyp to bend down its tentacles, which the
larva entangles with threads of silk, doing so by means of rapid,
darting movements; for the nettle-cells would prove fatal should they be
shot out against its body, which is soft. Its head is probably too
thickly coated with chitin to excite their discharge. Indeed, small
larvæ of this very species form no inconsiderable part of the food of
the polyp, and, so far as my observations go, a larva is always attacked
in the body and swallowed in a doubled-up position.</p>

<p>When the <i>Hydra</i> has been firmly built into the wall of the
shelters and its tentacles fastened down by their bases on the roof, the
larva proceeds, sometimes after an interval of some hours, to eat the
body, which it does very rapidly, leaving the tentacles attached to its
shelter. The meal only lasts for a few minutes; after it the larva
enjoys several hours' repose, protected by remains of its victim, which
retain a kind of vitality for some time. During this period it remains
still, except for certain undulatory movements of the posterior part of
the body which probably aid in respiration. Then it leaves the shelter
and goes in search of further prey. Its food, even when living in a
tunnel, does not consist entirely of <i>Hydra</i>. I have watched a
larva building its shelter near a number of rotifers, some of which it
devoured and some of which it plastered on to its tunnel.</p>

<p>The tubular shelters occasionally found are very much stouter
structures than the tunnels, but are apparently made fundamentally of
the same materials; and structures intermediate between them and the
tunnels are sometimes produced. The larva as a rule fastens to them
branches detached from living colonies of Vorticellid protozoa such as

<p>Of animals living in more or less intimate relations with the<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
polyp, I have found two very distinct species of protozoa, neither of
which is identical with either of the two commonly found in association
with <i>Hydra</i> in Europe, <i>Trichodina pediculus</i> and <i>Kerona
polyporum</i>. On two occasions, one in January and the other at the
beginning of February, I have seen a minute colourless flagellate on the
tentacles of the Calcutta polyp. On the first occasion the tentacles
were completely covered with this protozoon, so that they appeared at
first sight as though encased in flagellated epithelium. The minute
organism was colourless, transparent, considerably larger than the
spermatozoa of <i>Hydra</i>, slightly constricted in the middle and
rounded at each end. It bore a long flagellum at the end furthest from
its point of attachment, the method of which I could not ascertain. When
separated from the polyp little groups clung together in rosettes and
gyrated in the water. On the other occasion only a few individuals were
observed. Possibly this flagellate was a parasite rather than a
commensal, as the individual on which it swarmed was unusually emaciated
and colourless, and bore neither gonads nor buds. The larger stinging
cells were completely covered by groups of the organism, and possibly
this may have interfered with the discharge of stinging threads.</p>

<p>The other protozoon was <i>Vorticella monilata</i>, Tatem, which has
been found, not in association with <i>Hydra</i>, in Europe and S.
America. In Calcutta I have only seen it attached to the column of the
polyp, but probably it would also be found, if carefully looked for,
attached to water-weeds.</p>

<p>Especially in the four-rayed stage, the polyp not infrequently
attaches itself to shells of <i>Vivipara</i>, and, more rarely, to those
of other molluscs. It is doubtful whether this temporary association
between <i>Hydra</i> and the mollusc is of any importance to the latter.
Even when the polyp settles on its body and not on its shell (as is
sometimes the case) the <i>Vivipara</i> appears to suffer no
inconvenience, and makes no attempt to get rid of its burden. It is
possible, on the other hand, that the <i>Hydra</i> may protect it by
devouring would-be parasites; but of this there is no evidence<a
name="fnanchor_AU" id="fnanchor_AU"></a><a href="#footnote_AU"
class="fnanchor"><sup>[AU]</sup></a>.</p>

<p>The association, however, is undoubtedly useful to <i>Hydra</i>. The
mud on the shells of <i>Vivipara</i> taken on floating objects
shows<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg
158]</a></span> that in cool weather the snail comes up from the bottom
to the surface, and it probably goes in the opposite direction in hot
weather. Moreover, the common Calcutta species (<i>V. bengalensis</i>)
feeds very largely, if not exclusively, on minute green algæ. It
therefore naturally moves towards spots where smaller forms of animal
and vegetable life abound and conditions are favourable for the polyp.
The polyp's means of progression are limited, and the use of a beast of
burden is most advantageous to it, for it can detach itself when it
arrives at a favourable habitat. If specimens are kept in water which is
allowed to become foul, a very large proportion of them will attach
themselves to any snails confined with them. Under natural conditions
they would thus in all probability be rapidly conveyed to a more
suitable environment. In the tanks it is far commoner to find young
four-rayed polyps on <i>Vivipara</i> than individuals with five or six
rays; but the adults of the species are far less prone to change their
position than are the young.</p>

<p>The Calcutta <i>Hydra</i>, especially in spring, exhibits a distinct
tendency to frequent the neighbourhood of sponges and polyzoa, such as
<i>Spongilla carteri</i> and the denser forms of <i>Plumatella</i>.
Possibly this is owing to the shade these organisms provide.</p>

<p>This species differs from <i>H. vulgaris</i> in the following
characters:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote_b">(1) Even when the gastral cavity is empty, the
basal part of the column is distinctly more slender than the upper
part;<br />

(2) even when the animal is at rest, the tentacles are much longer than
the column;<br />

(3) the nettle-cells of both types are usually smaller and more uniform
in size than in the other species; those with barbed threads (fig. 27,
p.&nbsp;131) are always flask-shaped and somewhat narrower in proportion
to their length, while those with simple threads are pointed or almost
pointed at their distal end;<br />

(4) the stinging threads of the more complex form are comparatively
stout and short;<br />

(5) there are comparatively few nettle-cells in the column;<br />

(6) the egg-shell is nearly smooth or covered more or less completely
with short, simple spines (fig. 28, p.&nbsp;137).</p>

<p><i>H. oligactis</i> is usually a more vigorous form than <i>H.
vulgaris</i> and, in spite of its name, has often a considerable number
of tentacles. The few Indian specimens examined have, however, been
small and have not had more than six tentacles. I have not seen an
Indian specimen with more than two buds, but European specimens
sometimes produce a great many, and as the daughter buds do not always
separate from the parent until they have themselves produced buds,
temporary colonies of some complexity arise; Chun figures a specimen
with nineteen daughter and granddaughter buds<a name="fnanchor_AV"
id="fnanchor_AV"></a><a href="#footnote_AV"
class="fnanchor"><sup>[AV]</sup></a>.</p>

<p>In Europe and N. America there appear to be two races or phases of
the species. To avoid ambiguity they may be called form A and form B and
described as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote_b">Form A is of vigorous growth. It is as a rule
di&oelig;cious, and its reproductive organs may be borne practically at
any level on the surface of the column. Its eggs are spherical and as a
rule covered almost uniformly with spines.</p>

<p class="blockquote_b"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160"
id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>Form B is smaller and has smaller and
more variable nettle-cells. Its reproductive organs are borne only on
the distal third or at the base of its column and it is often
mon&oelig;cious. The lower surface of its egg is flattened, adherent,
and devoid of spines.</p>

<p>The larger form (A) was originally named <i>Hydra mon&oelig;cia</i>
by Downing, who in 1904 expressed a wish to substitute for the specific
name, which had been given through inadvertence, the more appropriate
one <i>di&oelig;cia</i>. As, however, it appears to be the commoner of
the two in northern Europe, we may regard it as probably being the one
named <i>Hydra oligactis</i> by Pallas and therefore may accept it as
the <i>forma typica</i> of that species. According to Brauer (1908) the
smaller form is Linné's <i>Hydra polypus</i>; but the original
description of the "species" hardly bears out this view. As reproductive
organs have not yet been found in Indian specimens, it is impossible to
say to which of the two forms they belong.</p>

<p>A red form of <i>H. oligactis</i> occurs in Tibet in the lake
Rham-tso, at an altitude of about 15,000 feet and has been reported from
various small lakes in mountainous parts of Europe. It is probably the
form called <i>Hydra rhætica</i> by Asper, but his figures are lacking
in detail and appear to have been drawn from specimens in a state of
partial contraction. <i>H. rubra</i>, Lewes (Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist. (3) v,
p.&nbsp;71, 1860), may also be identical with this form. Roux, indeed,
states that <i>H. rubra</i> is only found living unattached at
considerable depths (Ann. Biol. lacustre ii, p.&nbsp;266, 1907); but
this statement does not accord with the fact that Lewes's specimens were
found in ponds on Wimbledon Common.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Type</span> not in existence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Geographical Distribution.</span>&mdash;<i>H.
oligactis</i> is widely distributed in Europe and N. America, but in
India has only been found in and near the city of Lahore in the
Punjab.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Biology.</span>&mdash;This species was found by
Major J. Stephenson, I.M.S., in the basin of a fountain at Lahore and in
an ornamental canal in the Shalimar Gardens on the outskirts of the same
city. Nothing is known as regards its habits in this country. In N.
America, according to Downing, form B breeds in September and October
and form A from October to December. The eggs of form B remain attached
to the parent until the two cellular layers are formed and then drop
off, whereas those of form A are fixed by the parent to some extraneous
object, its column contracting until they are in a favourable position
for attachment.</p>

<p>The colour of Indian examples of <i>H. oligactis</i> apparently
resembles that of the Calcutta winter brood of <i>H. vulgaris</i> so far
as visual effect is concerned, but I have noticed in specimens from
Lahore and the neighbourhood that very minute spherical bodies of a dark
green colour are present in the endoderm cells.</p>

In the Calcutta tanks operculate molluscs such as <i>Vivipara</i> are
certainly more free from visible attack than non-operculate species.
This is the case for instance, as regards the common aquatic glowworm
(<i>Luciola</i> sp.), which destroys large numbers of individuals of
<i>Limnophysa</i>, <i>Limnæus</i>, &amp;c.  If it has been starved for
several days in an aquarium it will attack an operculate form, but
rarely with success. Similarly <i>Chætogaster bengalensis</i> attaches
itself exclusively to non-operculate forms. In the one case the polyp
could do very little against an adversary with so stout an integument as
the insect, while, in the other, it is doubtful whether the worm does
any harm to its host. The polyp would afford very little protection
against the snail's vertebrate enemies or against what appears to be its
chief foe, namely, drought. As the water sinks in the tank
non-operculate species migrate to the deeper parts, but <i>Vivipara</i>
and <i>Ampullaria</i> close their shells, remain where they are, and so
often perish, being left high and dry, exposed to the heat of the
sun.</p>

Pallas writes as regards this "pulcherrime vegetantem varietatem" with
his usual critical insight, "Vix tamen peculiaris speciei nomine
salutanda videtur." It is probably the <i>Hydra socialis</i> of
Linné.</p>

<h3 class="p4">INTRODUCTION TO PART III.</h3>

<p class="p2 center">I.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Status and Structure of the
Polyzoa.</span></p>

<p>The Polyzoa constitute a class in the third great division of the
animal kingdom, the so-called Triploblastea. In this division are
included also the worms, molluscs, insects, crustacea, spiders,
vertebrates, etc.; for heterogeneous as its elements appear, all these
animals may be considered to have essential features in common, in
particular a body consisting primarily of three cellular layers. Most of
them also possess a body cavity distinct from the alimentary canal. Some
authors regard the position of the polyzoa as near that of the higher
worms, but the group is an isolated one.</p>

<p>In considering the anatomy of simple forms of animal life such as the
sponges it is necessary to pay attention mainly to individual cells, but
in discussing more complicated forms our notice is first attracted to
tissues and organs, for the cells of which these tissues and organs are
composed have each a definite position, a definite structure, and a
definite function. The most characteristic feature of the polyzoa,
considered from this point of view, is the fact that most of their
organs fall into one of two categories and are connected either with
what is called the "zo&oelig;cium" or with what is known as the
"polypide." The zo&oelig;cium is a cage in which the polypide is
enclosed, but it is a living cage, differing from the shell of a snail
or the tubes in which many worms encase themselves in being part of the
animal itself. The polypide consists mainly of the organs connected
directly and indirectly with nutrition and of part of the muscular
system; its name is derived from the fact that it bears a superficial
resemblance to a polyp such as <i>Hydra</i>.</p>

<p>The shape and structure of the zo&oelig;cium differs greatly in
different groups of polyzoa. In its simplest form it is merely a
cylindrical tube of living matter which secretes an outer horny or
gelatinous covering. It is open at the end furthest from its base, at
which it is attached either to another zo&oelig;cium or to some kind of
supporting structure. Certain parts of the polypide can always be
extruded from the aperture, which is known technically as the "orifice,"
or withdrawn through it into the zo&oelig;cium.<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span> When the polypide is
retracted it draws in with it a portion of the zo&oelig;cium. The dead
outer layer or ectocyst lines part of the portion thus invaginated and
forms the walls of a cavity within the orifice. The base of this cavity
consists in many forms of a transverse partition pierced in the middle
by a circular hole and known as the "diaphragm." The diaphragm, however,
does not constitute the limit of the invaginated portion of the
zo&oelig;cium, for the living inner wall or endocyst is dragged in still
further and forms a sheath round the retracted tentacles. When the
tentacles are protruded they emerge through the hole in the diaphragm,
carrying with them their sheath of endocyst. The invagination above the
diaphragm, consisting of both endocyst and ectocyst, is then
everted.</p>

<p>The tentacles are a characteristic feature of the polypide. Together
with the base to which they are attached they are known as the
"lophophore"; they surround the mouth, usually in a circle. They differ
widely from the tentacles of <i>Hydra</i> in both structure and
function, although they too serve as organs for the capture of prey;
they are not highly contractile and are not provided with nettle-cells
but are covered with cilia, which are in constant motion. When extruded
they form a conspicuous calix-like crown to the zo&oelig;cium, but in
the retracted condition they are closely pressed together and lie
parallel to one another. They are capable individually of motion in all
directions but, although they usually move in concert, they cannot as a
rule seize objects between them.</p>

<p>The mouth is a hole situated in the midst of the tentacles. It leads
directly into a funnel-shaped &oelig;sophagus, the upper part of which
is lined with cilia and is sometimes distinguished as the "pharynx,"
while the lower part, the &oelig;sophagus proper, is a thin-walled tube
that connects the pharynx with the stomach, which it enters on the
dorsal side. The stomach is a bulky organ that differs markedly in form
and structure in different groups of polyzoa. It is lined internally
with glandular cells and the inner wall is sometimes thrown into folds
or "rugæ." The part with which the &oelig;sophagus communicates is known
as the "cardiac" portion, while the part whence the intestine originates
is called the "pylorus" or "pyloric" portion. The intestine commences on
the ventral side opposite the entrance of the &oelig;sophagus and nearly
on a level with it, the bulk of the stomach depending between the two
tubes. This part of the stomach is often produced into a blind tube, the
fundus or cæcum. The alimentary canal may therefore be described as
distinctly <b>Y</b>-shaped. The proximal part of the intestine is in
some forms lined with cilia, and the tube as a whole is usually divided
into two parts&mdash;the intestine proper, which is nearest the stomach,
and the rectum, which opens by the anus not far from the mouth.</p>

<p>The nervous system consists of a central ganglion or brain, which is
situated at the base of the tentacles on the side nearest the anus and
gives out radiating nerves in all directions. Close<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span> to
the brain and providing a communication between the cavity of the
zo&oelig;cium and the cavity in which the tentacles are contained (or,
in the case of an expanded polyp, the external world) is a ciliated tube
known as the "intertentacular organ." Apparently it acts as a passage
through which the genital products are expelled; but contradictory
statements have been made regarding it, and perhaps it is present only
at certain seasons or in certain conditions of the polypide.</p>

<p>The muscular system is often of a complicated nature, but three sets
of muscles may be distinguished as being of peculiar importance, viz.,
(i) the retractor muscles, which are fixed to the<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
base of the lophophore at one end and to the base of the zo&oelig;cium
at the other, and by contracting pull the former back into the
zo&oelig;cium; (ii) the parieto-vaginal muscles, which connect the upper
part of the invaginated portion of the zo&oelig;cium with the main wall
thereof; and (iii) the parietal muscles, which run round the inner wall
of the zo&oelig;cium and compress the zo&oelig;cium as a whole. The
parietal muscles are not developed in the Phylactolæmata, the most
highly specialized group of freshwater polyzoa.</p>

<p>The cavity between the polypide and the zo&oelig;cium contains a
reticulate tissue of cells known as the "funicular" tissue, and this
tissue is usually concentrated to form a hollow strand or strands
("funiculi") that connect the outer wall of the alimentary canal with
the endocyst.</p>

<p>This rapid sketch of the general anatomy of a simple polyzoon will be
the best understood by comparing it with fig. 30, which represents, in a
somewhat diagrammatic fashion, a vertical section through a single
zo&oelig;cium and polypide of the order Ctenostomata, to which some of
the freshwater species belong. The polypide is represented in a
retracted condition in which the <b>Y</b>-shaped <ins title="changed
from 'dispsition'">disposition</ins> of the alimentary canal is somewhat
obscured.</p>

<p>In the great majority of cases the polyzoa form permanent colonies or
polyparia, each of which consists of a number of individual zo&oelig;cia
and polypides connected together by threads of living tissue. These
colonies are formed by budding, not by independent individuals becoming
associated together. In a few cases compound colonies are formed owing
to the fact that separate simple colonies congregate and secrete a
common investment; but in these cases there is no organic connection
between the constituent colonies. It is only in the small subclass
Entoprocta, the polypides and zo&oelig;cia of which are not nearly so
distinct from one another as they are in other polyzoa (the Ectoprocta),
that mature solitary individuals occur.</p>

<p>As representatives of both subclasses of polyzoa and of more than one
order of Ectoprocta occur in fresh water, I have prefaced my description
of the Indian species with a synopsis of the more conspicuous characters
of the different groups (pp.&nbsp;183-186).</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Capture and Digestion of Food:
Elimination of Waste Products.</span></p>

<p>The food of all polyzoa consists of minute living organisms, but its
exact nature has been little studied as regards individual species and
genera. In <i>Victorella bengalensis</i> it consists largely of diatoms,
while the species of <i>Hislopia</i> and <i>Arachnoidea</i> possess an
alimentary canal modified for the purpose of retaining flagellate
organisms until they become encysted. Similar organisms form a large
part of the food of the phylactolæmata.</p>

<p>Although the tentacles may be correctly described as organs used in
capturing prey, they do not themselves seize it but waft<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span> it
by means of the currents set up by their cilia to the mouth, into which
it is swept by the currents produced by the cilia lining the pharynx.
The tentacles are also able in some species to interlace themselves in
order to prevent the escape of prey. Apparently they have the power of
rejecting unsuitable food, for they may often be observed to bend
backwards and forwards and thrust particles that have approached them
away, and if the water contains anything of a noxious nature in solution
the lophophore is immediately retracted, unless it has been completely
paralysed. In the phylactolæmata the peculiar organ known as the
epistome is capable of closing the mouth completely, and probably acts
as an additional safeguard in preventing the ingestion of anything of an
injurious nature.</p>

<p>In many genera and larger groups the food commonly passes down the
pharynx into the stomach without interruption, although it is probable
that in all species the &oelig;sophagus can be closed off from the
stomach by a valve at its base. In some forms, however, a "gizzard" is
interposed between the &oelig;sophagus and the stomach. This gizzard has
not the same function in all cases, for whereas in some forms
(<i>e.&nbsp;g.</i>, in <i>Bowerbankia</i>) it is lined with horny
projections and is a powerful crushing organ, in others
(<i>e.&nbsp;g.</i>, in <i>Hislopia</i> or <i>Victorella</i>) it acts as
an antechamber in which food can be preserved without being crushed
until it is required for digestion, or rough indigestible particles can
be retained which would injure the delicate walls of the stomach.</p>

<p>Digestion takes place mainly in the stomach, the walls of which are
of a glandular nature. The excreta are formed into oval masses in the
rectum and are extruded from the anus in this condition.</p>

<p>Although the gross non-nutritious parts of the food are passed <i>per
anum</i>, the waste products of the vital processes are not eliminated
so easily, and a remarkable process known as the formation of brown
bodies frequently takes place. This process cannot be described more
clearly and succinctly than by quoting Dr. Harmer's description of it
from pp.&nbsp;471 and 472 of vol. ii. of the Cambridge Natural History, a
volume to which I have been much indebted in the preparation of this
introduction. The description is based very largely on Dr. Harmer's own
observations<a name="fnanchor_AW" id="fnanchor_AW"></a><a
href="#footnote_AW" class="fnanchor"><sup>[AW]</sup></a>.</p>

<p>"The tentacles, alimentary canal, and nervous system break down, and
the tentacles cease to be capable of being protruded. The degenerating
organs become compacted into a rounded mass, known from its colour as
the 'brown body.' This structure may readily be seen in a large
proportion of the zo&oelig;cia of transparent species. In active parts
of the colony of the body-wall next develops an internal bud-like
structure, which rapidly acquires the form of a new polypide. This takes
the place originally occupied by the<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span> old polypide, while
the latter may either remain in the zo&oelig;cium in the permanent form
of a 'brown body,' or pass to the exterior. In <i>Flustra</i> the young
polypide-bud becomes connected with the 'brown body' by a funiculus. The
apex of the blind pouch or 'cæcum' of the young stomach is guided by
this strand to the 'brown body,' which it partially surrounds. The
'brown body' then breaks up, and its fragments pass into the cavity of
the stomach, from which they reach the exterior by means of the
anus."</p>

<p>Brown bodies are rarely if ever found in the phylactolæmata, in which
the life of the colony is always short; but they are not uncommon in
<i>Hislopia</i> and <i>Victorella</i>, although in the case of the
former they may easily escape notice on account of the fact that they
are much paler in colour than is usually the case. When they are found
in a ctenostome the collar-like membrane characteristic of the suborder
is extruded from the orifice (which then disappears) and remains as a
conspicuous external addition to the zo&oelig;cium, the ectocyst of
which, at any rate in <i>Bowerbankia</i> and <i>Victorella</i>,
sometimes becomes thickened and dark in colour.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that the colouring matter of the brown bodies is
practically the only colouring matter found in the polypides of most
polyzoa. Young polypides are practically colourless in almost all
cases.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Reproduction:
Budding.</span></p>

<p>Polyzoa reproduce their species in three ways&mdash;(i) by means of
eggs, (ii) by budding, and (iii) by means of bodies developed asexually
and capable of lying dormant in unfavourable conditions without losing
their vitality.</p>

<p>Most, if not all species are hermaphrodite, eggs and spermatozoa
being produced either simultaneously or in succession by each
individual, or by certain individuals in each zoarium. The reproductive
organs are borne on the inner surface of the endocyst, as a rule in a
definite position, and often in connection with the funiculus or
funiculi. It is doubtful to what extent eggs are habitually fertilized
by spermatozoa of the individual that has borne them, but in some cases
this is practically impossible and spermatozoa from other individuals
must be introduced into the zo&oelig;cium.</p>

<p>Budding as a rule does not result in the formation of independent
organisms, but is rather comparable to the proliferation that has become
the normal method of growth in sponges, except of course that
individuality is much more marked in the component parts of a polyzoon
colony than it is in a sponge. In the genera described in this volume
budding takes place by the outgrowth of a part of the body-wall and the
formation therein of a new polypide, but the order in which the buds
appear and their arrangement in reference to the parent zo&oelig;cium is
different in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169"
id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span> different groups. In the freshwater
ctenostomes three buds are typically produced from each zo&oelig;cium,
one at the anterior end and one at either side, the two latter being
exactly opposite one another. The parent zo&oelig;cium in this formation
arises from another zo&oelig;cium situated immediately behind it, so
that each zo&oelig;cium, except at the extremities of the zoarium, is
connected with four other zo&oelig;cia, the five together forming a
cross. The two lateral buds are, however, frequently suppressed, or only
one of them is developed, and a linear series of zo&oelig;cia with
occasional lateral branches is formed instead of a series of crosses. In
the phylactolæmata, on the other hand, the linear method of budding is
the typical one, but granddaughter-buds are produced long before the
daughter-buds are mature, so that the zo&oelig;cia are frequently
pressed together, and lateral buds are produced irregularly. In
<i>Victorella</i> additional adventitious buds are produced freely near
the tip of the zo&oelig;cium.</p>

<p>Reproduction by spontaneous fission sometimes occurs, especially in
the Lophopinæ, but the process differs from that which takes place when
a <i>Hydra</i> divides into two, for there is no division of individual
zo&oelig;cia or polypides but merely one of the whole zoarium.</p>

<p>The production of reproductive bodies analogous to the gemmules of
sponges appears to be confined in the polyzoa to the species that
inhabit fresh or brackish water, nor does it occur in all of these.</p>

<p>All the phylactolæmata produce, within their zo&oelig;cia, the bodies
known as statoblasts. These bodies consist essentially of masses of
cells containing abundant food-material and enclosed in a capsule with
thick horny walls. In many cases the capsule is surrounded by a
"swim-ring" composed of a mass of horny-walled chambers filled with air,
which renders the statoblast extremely light and enables it to float on
the surface of the water; while in some genera the margin of the
swim-ring bears peculiar hooked processes, the function of which is
obscure. The whole structure first becomes visible as a mass of cells
(the origin of all of which is not the same) formed in connection with
the funiculus, and the statoblast may be regarded as an internal bud.
Its origin and development in different genera has been studied by
several authors, notably by Oka<a name="fnanchor_AX"
id="fnanchor_AX"></a><a href="#footnote_AX"
class="fnanchor"><sup>[AX]</sup></a> in <i>Pectinatella</i>, and by
Braem<a name="fnanchor_AY" id="fnanchor_AY"></a><a href="#footnote_AY"
class="fnanchor"><sup>[AY]</sup></a> in <i>Cristatella</i>.</p>

<p>The external form of the statoblasts is very important in the
classification of the phylactolæmata, to which these structures are
confined. In all the genera that occur in India they are flattened and
have an oval, circular, or approximately oval outline.</p>

<p>In temperate climates statoblasts are produced in great<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
profusion at the approach of winter, but in India they occur, in most
species, in greatest numbers at the approach of the hot weather.</p>

<p>In the family Paludicellidæ (ctenostomata) external buds which
resemble the statoblasts in many respects are produced at the approach
of unfavourable climatic conditions, but no such buds are known in the
family Hislopiidæ, the zoaria of which appear to be practically
perennial. The buds consist of masses of cells formed at the points at
which ordinary buds would naturally be produced, but packed with
food-material and protected like statoblasts by a thick horny coat. It
seems also that old zo&oelig;cia and polypides are sometimes transformed
into buds of the kind (fig. 31), and it is possible that there is some
connection between the formation of brown bodies and their production.
Like the statoblasts of the phylactolæmata the resting buds of the
Paludicellidæ are produced in Europe at the approach of winter, and in
India at that of the hot weather.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Development.</span></p>

<p class="center">(a) <i>From the Egg.</i></p>

<p>Some polyzoa are oviparous, while in others a larva is formed within
the zo&oelig;cium and does not escape until it has attained some
complexity of structure. Both the ctenostomatous genera that are found
in fresh water in India are oviparous, but whereas in <i>Victorella</i>
the egg is small and appears to be extruded soon after its
fertilization, in <i>Hislopia</i> it remains in the zo&oelig;cium for a
considerable time, increases to a relatively large size, and in some
unknown manner accumulates a considerable amount of food-material before
escaping. Unfortunately the development is unknown in both genera.</p>

<p>In the phylactolæmata the life-history is much better known, having
been studied by several authors, notably by Allman, by Kraepelin, and by
Braem (1908). The egg is contained in a thin<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span> membrane, and while
still enclosed in the zo&oelig;cium, forms by regular division a hollow
sphere composed of similar cells. This sphere then assumes an ovoid
form, becomes covered with cilia externally, and breaks its way through
the egg-membrane into the cavity of the zo&oelig;cium. Inside the
embryo, by a process analogous to budding, a polypide or a pair of
polypides is formed. Meanwhile the embryo has become distinctly
pear-shaped, the polypide or polypides being situated at its narrow end,
in which a pore makes its appearance. The walls are hollow in the region
occupied by the polypide, the cavity contained in them being bridged by
slender threads of tissue. The larva thus composed makes its way out of
the zo&oelig;cium, according to Kraepelin through the orifice of a
degenerate bud formed for its reception, and swims about for a short
time by means of the cilia with which it is covered. Its broad end then
affixes itself to some solid object, the polypide is everted through the
pore at the narrow end and the whole of that part of the larva which
formerly enclosed it is turned completely inside out. A zoarium with its
included polypides is finally produced from the young polypide by the
rapid development of buds.</p>

<p class="p2 center">(b) <i>From the Statoblast and Resting
Buds.</i></p>

<p>There is little information available as regards the development of
the young polyzoon in the resting buds of the freshwater ctenostomes. In
<i>Paludicella</i> and <i>Pottsiella</i> the capsule of the bud splits
longitudinally into two valves and the polypide emerges between them;
but in <i>Victorella bengalensis</i> one of the projections on the
margin of the bud appears to be transformed directly into the tip of a
new zo&oelig;cium and the capsule is gradually absorbed.</p>

<p>Contradictory statements have been made as regards several important
points in the development of the statoblast and it is probable that
considerable differences exist in different species. The following facts
appear to be of general application. The cellular contents of the
capsule consist mainly of a mass of cells packed with food-material in a
granular form, the whole enclosed in a delicate membrane formed of flat
cells. When conditions become favourable for development a cavity
appears near one end of the mass and the cells that form its walls
assume a columnar form in vertical section. The cavity increases rapidly
in size, and, as it does so, a young polypide is budded off from its
walls. Another bud may then appear in a similar fashion, and the
zo&oelig;cium of the first bud assumes its characteristic features. The
capsule then splits longitudinally into two disk-like valves and the
young polypide, in some cases already possessing a daughter bud, emerges
in its zo&oelig;cium, adheres by its base to some external object and
produces a new polyparium by budding. The two valves of the statoblast
often remain attached to the zoarium that has emerged from between them
until it attains considerable dimensions (see <a href="#Plate_IV">Plate
IV</a>, fig. 3 <i>a</i>).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg
172]</a></span>What conditions favour development is a question that
cannot yet be answered in a satisfactory manner. Statoblasts can lie
dormant for months and even for years without losing their power of
germinating, and it is known that in Europe they germinate more readily
after being subjected to a low temperature. In tropical India this is,
of course, an impossible condition, but perhaps an abnormally high
temperature has the same effect. At any rate it is an established fact
that whereas the gemmules of most species germinate in Europe in spring,
in Bengal they germinate either at the beginning of the "rains" or at
that of our mild Indian winter.</p>

<p class="p2 center "><span class="smcap">Movements.</span></p>

</div>

<p>In the vast majority of the polyzoa, marine as well as freshwater,
movement is practically confined to the polypide, the external walls of
the zo&oelig;cium being rigid, the zo&oelig;cia being closely linked
together and the whole zoarium permanently fixed to some extraneous
object. In a few freshwater species belonging to the genera
<i>Cristatella</i>, <i>Lophopus</i>, <i>Lophopodella</i> and
<i>Pectinatella</i>, the whole zoarium has the power of progression.
This power is best developed in <i>Cristatella</i>, which glides along
with considerable rapidity on a highly specialized "sole" provided with
abundant mucus and representing all that remains of the ectocyst. It is
by no means clear how the zoaria of the other genera move from one place
to another, for the base is not modified, so far as can be seen, for the
purpose, and the motion is extremely slow. It is probable, however, that
progression is effected by alternate expansions and contractions of the
base, and in <i>Lophopodella</i> (fig. 32), which moves rather less
slowly than its allies, the anterior part of the base is raised at times
from the surface along which it is moving. The whole zoarium can be
released in this way and occasionally drops through the water, and is
perhaps carried by currents from one place to another in so doing.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg
173]</a></span>So far as the polypides are concerned, the most important
movements are those which enable the lophophore and the adjacent parts
to be extruded from and withdrawn into the zo&oelig;cium. The latter
movement is executed by means of the retractor muscles, which by
contracting drag the extruded parts back towards the posterior end of
the endocyst, but it is not by any means certain how the extrusion of
the lophophore is brought about. In most ctenostomes the action of the
parietal muscles doubtless assists in squeezing it out when the
retractor and parieto-vaginal muscles relax, but Oka states that
protrusion can be effected in the phylactolæmata even after the
zo&oelig;cium has been cut open. Possibly some hydrostatic action takes
place, however, and allowance must always be made for the natural
resilience of the inverted portion of the ectocyst.</p>

<p>Even when the polypide is retracted, muscular action does not cease,
for frequent movements, in some cases apparently rhythmical, of the
alimentary canal may be observed, and in <i>Hislopia</i> contraction of
the gizzard takes place at irregular intervals.</p>

<p>When the lophophore is expanded, the tentacles in favourable
circumstances remain almost still, except for the movements of their
cilia; but if a particle of matter too large for the mouth to swallow or
otherwise unsuitable is brought by the currents of the cilia towards it,
individual tentacles can be bent down to wave it away and similar
movements are often observed without apparent cause.</p>

<p>In the cheilostomes certain individuals of each zoarium are often
profoundly modified in shape and function and exhibit almost constant
rhythmical or convulsive movements, some ("avicularia") being shaped
like a bird's beak and snapping together, others ("vibracula") being
more or less thread-like and having a waving motion.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Distribution of the Freshwater
Polyzoa.</span></p>

<p>Fifteen genera of freshwater Polyzoa are now recognized, one
entoproctous and fourteen ectoproctous; five of the latter are
ctenostomatous and nine phylactolæmatous. Of the fourteen ectoproctous
genera seven are known to occur in India, viz., <i>Victorella</i>,
<i>Hislopia</i>, <i>Fredericella</i>, <i>Plumatella</i>,
<i>Stolella</i>, <i>Lophopodella</i>, and <i>Pectinatella</i>. Except
<i>Stolella</i>, which is only known from northern India, these genera
have an extremely wide geographical range; <i>Victorella</i> occurs in
Europe, India, Africa, and Australia; <i>Hislopia</i> in India,
Indo-China, China, and Siberia; <i>Fredericella</i> in Europe, N.
America, Africa, India, and Australia; <i>Plumatella</i> in all
geographical regions; <i>Lophopodella</i> in E. and S. Africa, India,
and Japan; <i>Pectinatella</i> in Europe, N. America, Japan, and
India.</p>

<p>Two genera, <i>Paludicella</i> and <i>Lophopus</i>, have been stated
on insufficient grounds to occur in India. The former is known<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
from Europe and N. America, and is said to have been found in Australia,
while the latter is common in Europe and N. America and also occurs in
Brazil.</p>

<p>Of the genera that have not been found in this country the most
remarkable are <i>Urnatella</i> and <i>Cristatella</i>. The former is
the only representative in fresh water of the Entoprocta and has only
been found in N. America. Each individual is borne upon a segmented
stalk the segments of which are enclosed in strong horny coverings and
are believed to act as resting buds. <i>Cristatella</i>, which is common
in Europe and N. America, is a phylactolæmatous genus of highly
specialized structure. It possesses a creeping "sole" or organ of
progression at the base of the zoarium.</p>

<p>The other phylactolæmatous genera that do not occur in India appear
to be of limited distribution, for <i>Australella</i> is only known from
N. S. Wales, and <i>Stephanella</i> from Japan. The ctenostomatous
<i>Arachnoidea</i> has only been reported from Lake Tanganyika, and
<i>Pottsiella</i> only from a single locality in N. America.</p>

<p>As regards the exotic distribution of the Indian species little need
be said. The majority of the <i>Plumatellæ</i> are identical with
European species, while the only species of <i>Fredericella</i> that has
been discovered is closely allied to the European one. The Indian
species of <i>Lophopodella</i> occurs also in E. Africa and Japan, while
that of <i>Pectinatella</i> is apparently confined to India, Burma and
Ceylon, but is closely allied to a Japanese form.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Polyzoa of Brackish
Water.</span></p>

<p>With the exception of <i>Victorella</i>, which occurs more commonly
in brackish than in fresh water and has been found in the sea, the
genera that occur in fresh water are confined or practically confined to
that medium; but certain marine ctenostomes and cheilostomes not
uncommonly make their way, both in Europe and in India, into brackish
water, and in the delta of the Ganges an entoproctous genus also does
so. The ctenostomatous genera that are found occasionally in brackish
water belong to two divisions of the suborder, the Vesicularina and the
Alcyonellea. To the former division belongs <i>Bowerbankia</i>, a form
of which (<i>B. caudata</i> subsp. <i>bengalensis</i>, p.&nbsp;187) is
often found in the Ganges delta with <i>Victorella bengalensis</i>. No
species of Alcyonellea has, however, as yet been found in Indian
brackish waters. The two Indian cheilostomes of brackish water belong to
a genus (<i>Membranipora</i>) also found in similar situations in
Europe. One of them (<i>M. lacroixii</i><a name="fnanchor_AZ"
id="fnanchor_AZ"></a><a href="#footnote_AZ"
class="fnanchor"><sup>[AZ]</sup></a>) is, indeed, identical with a
European form<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg
175]</a></span> that occurs in England both in the sea and in ditches of
brackish water. I have found it in the Cochin backwaters, in ponds of
brackish water at the south end of the Chilka Lake (Ganjam, Madras), on
the shore at Puri in Orissa, and in the Mutlah River at Port Canning.
The second species (<i>M. bengalensis</i>, Stoliczka) is peculiar to the
delta of the Ganges<a name="fnanchor_BA" id="fnanchor_BA"></a><a
href="#footnote_BA" class="fnanchor"><sup>[BA]</sup></a> and has not as
yet been found in the open sea. The two species are easily recognized
from one another, for whereas the lip of <i>M. bengalensis</i> (fig. 33)
bears a pair of long forked spines, there are no such structures on that
of <i>M. lacroixii</i>, the dorsal surface of which is remarkably
transparent. <i>M. lacroixii</i> forms a flat zoarium, the only part
visible to the naked eye being often the beaded margin of the
zo&oelig;cia, which appears as a delicate reticulation on bricks, logs
of wood, the stems of rushes and of hydroids, etc.; but the zoarium of
<i>M. bengalensis</i> is as a rule distinctly foliaceous and has a
peculiar silvery lustre.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">History of the Study of the
Freshwater Polyzoa.</span></p>

<p>The naturalists of the eighteenth century were acquainted with more
than one species of freshwater polyzoon, but they did not distinguish
these species from the hydroids. Trembley discovered <i>Cristatella</i>,
which he called "Polype à Panache," in 1741, and Linné described a
species of <i>Plumatella</i> under the name <i>Tubipora repens</i> in
1758, while ten years later Pallas gave a much fuller description (under
the name <i>Tubularia fungosa</i>) of the form now known as
<i>Plumatella fungosa</i> or <i>P. repens</i> var. <i>fungosa</i>.
Although Trembley, Baker, and other early writers on the fauna of fresh
water published valuable biological notes, the first really important
work of a comprehensive nature was that of Dumortier and van Beneden,
published in 1848. All previous memoirs were, however, superseded by
Allman's Monograph of the Fresh-Water Polyzoa, which was issued in 1857,
and this memoir remains in certain respects the most satisfactory that
has yet been produced. In 1885 Jullien published a revision of the
phylactolæmata and freshwater ctenostomes which is unfortunately
vitiated by some curious lapses in observation, but it is to Jullien
that the recognition of the proper position of <i>Hislopia</i> is due.
The next comprehensive monograph was that of Kraepelin, which appeared
in two parts (1887 and 1892) in the Abhandlungen des Naturwiss. Vereins
of Hamburg. In its detailed information and carefully executed
histological plates this work is superior to any that preceded it or has
since appeared, but the system of classification adopted is perhaps less
liable to criticism than that followed by Braem in his "Untersuchungen,"
published in the Bibliotheca Zoologica in 1888.</p>

<p>During the second half of the nineteenth century and the first decade
of the twentieth several authors wrote important works on the embryology
and anatomy of the phylactolæmata, notably Kraepelin, Braem, and Oka;
but as yet the ctenostomes of fresh water have received comparatively
little attention from anything but a systematic point of view.</p>

<p>From all points of view both the phylactolæmata and the ctenostomes
of Asia have been generally neglected, except in the case of the
Japanese phylactolæmata, which have been studied by Oka. Although Carter
made some important discoveries as regards the Indian forms, he did not
devote to them the same attention as he did to the sponges. In the case
of the only new genus he described he introduced a serious error into
the study of the two groups by placing <i>Hislopia</i> among the
cheilostomes, instead of in its true position as the type genus of a
highly specialized family of ctenostomes.</p>

<p>For fuller details as to the history of the study of the freshwater
Polyzoa the student may refer to Allman's and to Kraepelin's monographs.
An excellent summary is given by Harmer in his<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span> chapter on the
freshwater Polyzoa in vol. ii. of the Cambridge Natural History; and
Loppens has recently (1908) published in the Annales de Biologie
lacustre a concise survey of the systematic work that has recently been
undertaken. Unfortunately he perpetuates Carter's error as regards the
position of <i>Hislopia</i>.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Bibliography of the Freshwater
Polyzoa.</span></p>

<p>A very full bibliography of the freshwater Polyzoa will be found in
pt. i. of Kraepelin's "Die Deutschen Süsswasserbryozoen" (1887), while
Loppens, in his survey of the known species (Ann. Biol. lacustre, ii,
1908), gives some recent references. The following list contains the
titles of some of the more important works of reference, of memoirs on
special points such as reproduction and of papers that have a special
reference to Asiatic species. Only the last section is in any way
complete.</p>

<h5>OF THE</h5>
<h3>CLASSIFICATION OF THE POLYZOA.</h3>

<p class="p2 center">I.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Synopsis of the Subclasses,
Orders, and Suborders.</span></p>

<p class="center larger">Class POLYZOA.</p>

<p>Small c&oelig;lomate animals, each individual of which consists of a
polyp-like organism or polypide enclosed in a "house" or zo&oelig;cium
composed partly of living tissues. The mouth is surrounded by a circle
of ciliated tentacles that can be retracted within the zo&oelig;cium;
the alimentary canal, which is suspended in the zo&oelig;cium, is <span
style="white-space:nowrap;"><b>Y</b>-shaped</span> and consists of three
parts, the &oelig;sophagus, the stomach, and the intestine.</p>

<p class="p2 center">Subclass <b>ENTOPROCTA</b>.</p>

<p>The anus as well as the mouth is enclosed in the circle of tentacles
and the zo&oelig;cium is not very distinctly separated from the
polypide. Some forms are solitary or form temporary colonies by
budding.</p>

<p>Most Entoprocta are marine, but a freshwater genus (<i>Urnatella</i>)
occurs in N. America, while the Indian genus <i>Loxosomatoides</i> (fig.
34, p.&nbsp;176) is only known from brackish water.</p>

<p class="p2 center">Subclass <b>ECTOPROCTA</b>.</p>

<p>The anus is outside the circle of tentacles and the zo&oelig;cium can
always be distinguished from the polypide. All species form by budding
permanent communities the individuals in which remain connected together
by living tissue.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184"
id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>Order I. <b>GYMNOLÆMATA.</b></p>

<p>Ectoproctous polyzoa the polypides of which have no epistome; the
zo&oelig;cia are in nearly all cases distinctly separated from one
another by transverse perforated plates.</p>

<p>Most of the Gymnolæmata are marine, but species belonging to two of
the three suborders into which they are divided often stray into
brackish water, while a few genera that belong to one of these two
suborders are practically confined to fresh water. The three suborders
are distinguished as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2 center">Suborder A. <i>CHEILOSTOMATA.</i></p>

<p>The zo&oelig;cia are provided with a "lip" or lid hinged to the
posterior margin of the orifice (see fig. 33, p.&nbsp;175). This lid
closes automatically outside the zo&oelig;cium or in a special chamber
on the external surface (the "peristome") when the polypide retracts and
is pushed open by the tentacles as they expand. The majority of the
zo&oelig;cia in each zoarium are more or less distinctly flattened, but
some of them are often modified to form "vibracula" and
"avicularia."</p>

<p>The Cheilostomata are essentially a marine group, but some species
are found in estuaries and even in pools and ditches of brackish water

<p>The zo&oelig;cia are provided with a collar-like membrane which is
pleated vertically and closes together above the polypide inside the
zo&oelig;cium when the former is retracted; it is thrust out of the
zo&oelig;cium and expands into a ring-shaped form just before the
tentacles are extruded. The zo&oelig;cia are usually more or less
tubular, but in some genera and species are flattened.</p>

almost exclusively in fresh water.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Synopsis of the Leading Characters
of the Divisions of the Suborder Ctenostomata.</span></p>

<p class="p2 center">Suborder B. <i>CTENOSTOMATA.</i></p>

<p>The suborder has been subdivided in various ways by different
authors. The system here adopted is essentially the same as that
proposed in a recent paper by Waters (Journ. Linn. Soc. London, Zool.
xxi, p.&nbsp;231, 1910), but I have thought it necessary to add a fourth
division to the three adopted by that author, namely, the Alcyonellea,
Stolonifera, and Vesicularina. This new division includes all the
freshwater genera and may be known as the Paludicellina. In none of
these divisions are the tentacles webbed at the base.</p>

<p>The four divisions may be recognized from the following synopsis of
their characteristic features:&mdash;</p>

<p class="p2 center">Division I. ALCYONELLEA.</p>

<p>The zo&oelig;cia arise directly from one another in a fleshy or
gelatinous mass. The polypide has no gizzard. The species are
essentially marine, but a few are found in brackish water in
estuaries.</p>

<p class="p2 center">Division II. STOLONIFERA.</p>

<p>The zo&oelig;cia arise from expansions in a delicate creeping rhizome
or root-like structure, the order in which they are connected together
being more or less irregular. As a rule (perhaps always) there is no
gizzard. The species are marine.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186"
id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>Division III. VESICULARINA.</p>

<p>The zo&oelig;cia grow directly from a tubular stem which is usually
free and vertical, their arrangement being alternate, spiral or
irregular. There is a stout gizzard which bears internal chitinous
projections and is tightly compressed when the polypide is retracted.
The species are essentially marine, but a few are found in brackish
water.</p>

<p class="p2 center">Division IV. PALUDICELLINA, nov.</p>

<p>The zo&oelig;cia are arranged in a regular cruciform manner and arise
either directly one from another or with the intervention of tubular
processes. If the polypide has a gizzard it does not bear internal
chitinous projections. Most of the species are confined to fresh water,
but a few are found in brackish water or even in the sea.</p>

<p>Although all true freshwater Ctenostomes belong to the fourth of
these divisions, species of a genus (<i>Bowerbankia</i>) included in the
third are so frequently found in brackish water and in association with
one belonging to the fourth, and are so easily confounded with the
latter, that I think it necessary to include a brief description of the
said genus and of the form that represents it in ponds of brackish water
in India.</p>

the zo&oelig;cia representing the hairs become much elongated; but
upright branches are never formed. The zoarium has a greenish or greyish

</div>

<p><i>Zoarium.</i> The zoarium is recumbent or erect, and is formed
typically either of zo&oelig;cia arising directly in cruciform formation
from one another, or of zo&oelig;cia joined together in similar
formation with the intervention of tubules arising from their own bases.
Complications often arise, however, either on account of the suppression
of the lateral buds of a zo&oelig;cium, so that the formation becomes
linear instead of cruciform, or by the production in an irregular manner
of additional tubules and buds from the upper part of the zo&oelig;cia.
A confused and tangled zoarium may thus be formed, the true nature of
which can only be recognized by the examination of its terminal
parts.</p>

<p><i>Zo&oelig;cia.</i> The zo&oelig;cia are tubular and have a terminal
or subterminal orifice, which is angulate or subangulate as seen from
above. Owing to this fact, to the stiff nature of the external ectocyst,
to the action of circular muscles that surround the tentacular sheath,
and to the cylindrical form of the soft inverted part, the orifice, as
seen from above, appears to form four flaps or valves, thus <img
src="images/i199.png" style="vertical-align:middle" width="50"
height="42"  alt="Illustration: Valve design" title="Valve design"
/>.</p>

<p><i>Polypide.</i> The alimentary canal is elongate and slender as a
whole, the &oelig;sophagus (including the pharynx) being of considerable
length. In <i>Paludicella</i> and <i>Pottsiella</i> the &oelig;sophagus
opens directly into the cardiac limb of the stomach, which is distinctly
constricted at its base; but in <i>Victorella</i> the base of the
&oelig;sophagus is constricted off from the remainder to form an
elongate oval sac the walls of which are lined with a delicate
structureless membrane. <i>Victorella</i> may therefore be said to
possess a gizzard, but the structure that must be so designated has not
the function (that of crushing food) commonly associated with the name,
acting merely as a chamber for the retention of solid particles. In this
genus the cardiac limb of the stomach is produced and vertical but not
constricted at the base. The tentacles in most species number 8, but in
<i>Paludicella</i> there are 16.</p>

<p><i>Resting buds.</i> The peculiar structures known in Europe as
"hibernacula" are only found in this family. The name hibernacula,
however, is inappropriate to the only known Indian species<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span> as
they are formed in this country at the approach of summer instead of, as
in Europe and N. America, at that of winter. It is best, therefore, to
call them "resting buds." They consist of masses of cells congregated at
the base of the zo&oelig;cia, gorged with food material and covered with
a resistant horny covering.</p>

<p>The family Paludicellidæ consists of three genera which may be
distinguished as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table summary="Family Paludicellidæ">

<tr><td class="left_a">I.</td><td class="left_a">Orifice terminal; main

<p>Of these three genera, <i>Pottsiella</i> has not yet been found in
India and is only known to occur in N. America. It consists of one
species, <i>P. erecta</i> (Potts) from the neighbourhood of Philadelphia
in the United States.</p>

<p><i>Victorella</i> includes four species, <i>V. pavida</i> known from
England and Germany and said to occur in Australia, <i>V. mülleri</i>
from Germany (distinguished by possessing parietal muscles at the tip of
the zo&oelig;cia), <i>V. symbiotica</i> from African lakes and <i>V.
bengalensis</i> from India. These species are closely related.</p>

<p><i>Paludicella</i> is stated by Carter to have been found in Bombay,
but probably what he really found was the young stage of <i>V.
bengalensis</i>. A single species is known in Europe and N. America,
namely <i>P. ehrenbergi</i>, van Beneden (=<i>Alcyonella articulata</i>,
Ehrenberg).</p>

<p><i>Zoarium.</i> The nature of the zoarium in this genus is well
expressed by Ehrenberg's specific name "<i>articulata</i>," although the
name was given under a false impression. The zo&oelig;cia arise directly
from one another in linear series with occasional side-branches. The
side-branches are, however, often suppressed. The zoarium as a whole is
either recumbent and adherent or at least partly vertical.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg
193]</a></span><i>Zo&oelig;cia.</i> Although the zo&oelig;cia are
distinctly tubular as a whole, two longitudinal axes may be
distinguished in each, for the tip is bent upwards in a slanting
direction, bearing the orifice at its extremity. The main axis is,
however, at right angles to the dorso-ventral axis, and the dorsal
surface, owing to the position of the aperture, can always be readily
distinguished from the ventral, even when the position of the
zo&oelig;cium is vertical. Each zo&oelig;cium tapers towards the
posterior extremity. Parietal muscles are always present.</p>

<p><i>Polypide.</i> The most striking features of the polypide are the
absence of any trace of a gizzard and the highly specialized form
assumed by the cardiac part of the stomach. There are two funiculi, both
connecting the pyloric part of the stomach with the endocyst. The ovary
develops at the end of the upper, the testis at that of the lower
funiculus.</p>

<p><i>Resting buds.</i> The resting buds are spindle-shaped.</p>

<p>Kraepelin recognized two species in the genus mainly by their method
of growth and the number of tentacles. In his <i>P. mülleri</i> the
zoarium is always recumbent and the polypide has 8 tentacles, whereas in
<i>P. articulata</i> or <i>ehrenbergi</i> the tentacles number 16 and
upright branches are usually developed. It is probable,<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
however, that the former species should be assigned to
<i>Victorella</i>, for it is often difficult to distinguish
<i>Paludicella</i> from young specimens of <i>Victorella</i> unless the
latter bear adventitious terminal buds. The gizzard of <i>Victorella</i>
can be detected in well-preserved material even under a fairly low power
of the microscope, and I have examined specimens of what I believe to be
the adult of <i>mülleri</i> which certainly belong to that genus.</p>

<p>It is always difficult to see the collar of <i>Paludicella</i>,
because of its transparency and because of the fact that its pleats are
apparently not strengthened by chitinous rods as is usually the case.
Allman neither mentions it in his description of the genus nor shows it
in his figures, and Loppens denies its existence, but it is figured by
Kraepelin and can always be detected in well-preserved specimens, if
they are examined carefully. If the collar were actually absent, its
absence would separate <i>Paludicella</i> not only from
<i>Victorella</i> and <i>Pottsiella</i>, but also from all other
ctenostomes. In any case, <i>Victorella</i> is distinguished from
<i>Paludicella</i> and <i>Pottsiella</i> by anatomical peculiarities
(<i>e.&nbsp;g.</i>, the possession of a gizzard and the absence of a
second funiculus) that may ultimately be considered sufficiently great
to justify its recognition as the type and only genus of a separate
family or subfamily.</p>

<p>The description of <i>Paludicella</i> is included here on account of
Carter's identification of the specimens he found at Bombay; but its
occurrence in India is very doubtful.</p>

<p><i>Zoarium.</i> The zoarium consists primarily of a number of erect
or semi-erect tubular zo&oelig;cia joined together at the base in a
cruciform manner by slender tubules, but complications are introduced by
the fact that adventitious buds and tubules are produced, often in large
numbers, round the terminal region of the zo&oelig;cia, and that these
buds are often separated from their parent zo&oelig;cium by a tubule of
considerable length, and take root among other zo&oelig;cia at a
distance from their point of origin. A tangled mass may thus be formed
in which it is difficult to recognize the regular arrangement of the
zo&oelig;cia that can be readily detached at the growing points of the
zoarium.</p>

<p><i>Zo&oelig;cia.</i> The zo&oelig;cia when young closely resemble
those of <i>Paludicella</i>, but as they grow the terminal upturned part
increases rapidly, while the horizontal basal part remains almost
stationary and finally appears as a mere swelling at the base of an
almost vertical tube, in which by far the greater part, if not the
whole, of the polypide is contained. Round the terminal part of
this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg
195]</a></span> tube adventitious buds and tubules are arranged more or
less regularly. There are no parietal muscles.</p>

<p><i>Polypide.</i> The polypide has 8 slender tentacles, which are
thickly covered with short hairs. The basal part of the &oelig;sophagus
forms a thin-walled sac (the "gizzard") constricted off from the upper
portion and bearing internally a thin structureless membrane. Circular
muscles exist in its wall but are not strongly developed on its upper
part. There is a single funiculus, which connects the posterior end of
the stomach with the base of the zo&oelig;cium. The ovaries and testes
are borne on the endocyst, not in connection with the funiculus.</p>

<p><i>Resting buds.</i> The resting buds are flattened or resemble young
zo&oelig;cia in external form.</p>

<p><i>Victorella</i>, although found in fresh water, occurs more
commonly in brackish water and is known to exist in the littoral zone of
the sea.</p>

<p><i>Zoarium.</i> <i>The mature zoarium resembles a thick fur</i>, the
hairs of which are represented by elongate, erect, slender tubules (the
zo&oelig;cia), the arrangement of the whole being very complicated and
irregular. The base of the zoarium often consists of an irregular
membrane formed of matted tubules, which are sometimes agglutinated
together by a gummy secretion. The zoarium as a whole has a faint
yellowish tinge.</p>

<p><i>Zo&oelig;cia.</i> The zo&oelig;cia when young are practically
recumbent, each being of an ovoid form and having a stout, distinctly
quadrate orificial tubule projecting upwards and slightly forwards near
the anterior margin of the dorsal surface. At this stage a single
tubule, often of great relative length, is often given off near the
orifice, bearing a bud at its free extremity. As the zo&oelig;cium grows
the tubular part becomes much elongated as compared with the basal part
and assumes a vertical position. Its quadrate form sometimes persists
but more often disappears, so that it becomes almost circular in
cross-section throughout its length. Buds are produced near the tip in
considerable profusion. As a rule, if they appear at this stage, the
tubule connecting them with the parent zo&oelig;cium is short or
obsolete; sometimes they are produced only on one side of the
zo&oelig;cium, sometimes on two. The buds themselves produce
granddaughter and great-granddaughter buds, often connected together by
short tubules, while still small and imperfectly developed. The swelling
at the base of the zo&oelig;cium, when the latter is fully formed, is
small.</p>

<p><i>Polypide.</i> The polypide has the features characteristic of the
genus. The base of the gizzard is surrounded by a strong circular
muscle.</p>

p.&nbsp;170) are somewhat variable in shape but are always flat with
irregular cylindrical or subcylindrical projections round the margin, on
which the horny coat is thinner than it is on the upper surface. This
surface is either smooth or longitudinally ridged.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Type</span> in the Indian Museum.</p>

<p>This species differs from the European <i>V. pavida</i> in very much
the same way as, but to a greater extent than, the Indian race of
<i>Bowerbankia caudata</i> does from the typical English one (see p.
189). The growth of the zoarium is much more luxuriant, and the form of
the resting buds is different.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Geographical Distribution.</span>&mdash;<i>V.
bengalensis</i> is abundant in pools of brackish water in the Ganges
delta and in the Salt Lakes near Calcutta; it also occurs in ponds of
fresh water near the latter. I have received specimens from Madras from
Dr. J. R. Henderson, and it is probable that the form from Bombay
referred by Carter to <i>Paludicella</i> belonged to this species.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Biology.</span>&mdash;In the Ganges delta <i>V.
bengalensis</i> is usually found coating the roots and stems of a
species of grass that grows in and near brackish water, and on sticks
that have fallen into the water. It also spreads over the surface of
bricks, and I have found a specimen on a living shell of the common
mollusc <i>Melania tuberculata</i>. Dr. Henderson obtained specimens at
Madras from the surface of a freshwater shrimp, <i>Palæmon
malcolmsonii</i>. In the ponds at Port Canning the zoaria grow side by
side with, and even entangled with those of <i>Bowerbankia caudata</i>
subsp. <i>bengalensis</i>, to the zo&oelig;cia of which their
zo&oelig;cia bear a very strong external resemblance so far as their
distal extremity is concerned. This resemblance, however, disappears in
the case of zo&oelig;cia that bear terminal buds, for no such buds are
borne by <i>B. caudata</i>; and the yellowish tint of the zoaria of
<i>V. bengalensis</i> is characteristic. Zoaria of the entoproct
<i>Loxosomatoides colonialis</i> and colonies of the hydroid <i>Irene
ceylonensis</i> are also found entangled with the zoaria of <i>V.
bengalensis</i>, the zo&oelig;cia of which are often covered with
various species of Vorticellid protozoa and small rotifers. The growth
of <i>V. bengalensis</i> is more vigorous than that of the other polyzoa
found with it, and patches of <i>B. caudata</i> are frequently
surrounded by large areas of <i>V. bengalensis</i>.</p>

<p>The food of <i>V. bengalensis</i> consists largely of diatoms, the
siliceous shells of which often form the greater part of its excreta.
Minute particles of silt are sometimes retained in the gizzard, being
apparently swallowed by accident.</p>

<p>There are still many points to be elucidated as regards the
production and development of the resting buds in <i>V. bengalensis</i>,
but two facts are now quite clear as regards them: firstly, that these
buds are produced at the approach of the hot weather and germinate in
November or December; and secondly, that the whole zoarium may be
transformed at the former season into a layer of resting buds closely
pressed together but sometimes exhibiting in their arrangement the
typical cruciform formation. Resting buds may often be found in vigorous
colonies as late as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198"
id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span> the beginning of December; these buds
have not been recently formed but have persisted since the previous
spring and have not yet germinated. Sometimes only one or two buds are
formed at the base of an existing zo&oelig;cium (fig. 37 <i>a</i>), but
apparently it is possible not only for a zo&oelig;cium to be transformed
into a resting bud but for it to produce four other buds round its base
before undergoing the change. Young polypides are formed inside the buds
and a single zo&oelig;cium sprouts out of each, as a rule by the growth
of one of the basal projections, when conditions are favourable.</p>

<p>Polypides of <i>V. bengalensis</i> are often transformed into brown
bodies. When this occurs the orifice closes together, with the collar
expanded outside the zo&oelig;cium. I have occasionally noticed that the
ectocyst of such zo&oelig;cia was distinctly thicker and darker in
colour than that of normal zo&oelig;cia.</p>

<p>Eggs and spermatozoa are produced in great numbers, as a rule
simultaneously in the same zo&oelig;cia, but individuals kept in
captivity often produce spermatozoa only. The eggs are small and are set
free as eggs. Nothing is known as regards their development.</p>

<p>Polypides are as a rule found in an active condition only in the cold
weather, but I have on one occasion seen them in this condition in
August, in a small zoarium attached to a shell of <i>Melania
tuberculata</i> taken in a canal of brackish water near Calcutta.</p>

Carter.</p>

<p><i>Zoarium.</i> The zoarium consists primarily of a main axis running
in a straight line, with lateral branches that point forwards and
outwards. Further proliferation, however, often compacts the structure
into an almost uniform flat area.</p>

<p><i>Zo&oelig;cia.</i> The zo&oelig;cia (fig. 35 B, p.&nbsp;190) are
flat and have the orifice surrounded by a chitinous rim but not much
raised above the dorsal surface. They arise directly one from
another.</p>

<p><i>Polypide.</i> The polypide possesses from 12 to 20 tentacles. Its
funiculus is rudimentary or absent. Neither the ovaries nor the testes
have any fixed position on the lateral walls of the zo&oelig;cium to
which they are confined.</p>

<p>The position of this genus has been misunderstood by several
zoologists. Carter originally described <i>Hislopia</i> as a cheilostome
allied to <i>Flustra</i>; in 1880 Jullien perpetuated the error in<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
describing his <i>Norodonia</i>, which was founded on dried specimens of
Carter's genus; while Loppens in 1908 still regarded the two "genera" as
distinct and placed them both among the cheilostomes. In 1885, however,
Jullien retracted his statement that <i>Norodonia</i> was a cheilostome
and placed it, together with <i>Hislopia</i>, in a family of which he
recognized the latter as the eponymic genus. Carter's mistake arose from
the fact that he had only examined preserved specimens, in which the
thickened rim of the orifice is strongly reminiscent of the "peristome"
of certain cheilostomes, while the posterior of the four folds into
which the tentacle sheath naturally falls (as in all ctenostomes,
<i>cf.</i> the diagram on p.&nbsp;191) is in certain conditions rather
larger than the other three and suggests the "lip" characteristic of the
cheilostomes. If living specimens are examined, however, it is seen at
once that the posterior fold, like the two lateral folds and the
anterior one, changes its form and size from time to time and has no
real resemblance to a "lip."</p>

<p>That there is a remarkable, if superficial, resemblance both as
regards the form of the zo&oelig;cium and as regards the method of
growth between <i>Hislopia</i> and certain cheilostomes cannot be
denied, but the structure of the orifice and indeed of the whole
organism is that of a ctenostome and the resemblance must be regarded as
an instance of convergence rather than of genetic relationship.</p>

<p>The most striking feature of the polypide of <i>Hislopia</i> is its
gizzard (fig. 38, p.&nbsp;201) which is perhaps unique (except for that
of <i>Arachnoidea</i>) both in structure and function. In structure its
peculiarities reside mainly in three particulars: (i), it is not
constricted off directly from the thin-walled &oelig;sophageal tube, but
possesses at its upper extremity a thick-walled tubular portion which
can be entirely closed from the &oelig;sophagus at its upper end but
always remains in communication with the spherical part of the gizzard;
(ii), this spherical part of the gizzard is uniformly lined with a thick
chitinous or horny layer which in optical section has the appearance of
a pair of ridges; and (iii), there is a ring of long and very powerful
cilia round the passage from the gizzard to the stomach. The cardiac
limb of the stomach, which is large and heart-shaped, is obsolete. The
wall of the spherical part of the gizzard consists of two layers of
cells, an outer muscular layer consisting of powerful circular muscles
and an inner glandular layer, which secretes the chitinous lining. The
inner walls of the tubular part consist of non-ciliated columnar cells,
and when the polypide is retracted it lies almost at right angles to the
main axis of the zo&oelig;cium.</p>

<p>The spherical part of the gizzard invariably contains a number of
green cells, which lie free in the liquid it holds and are kept in
motion by the cilia at its lower aperture. The majority of these cells
can be seen with the aid of a high power of the microscope to consist of
a hard spherical coat or cyst containing green protoplasm in which a
spherical mass of denser substance (the nucleus) and a number of minute
transparent granules can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201"
id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span> sometimes be detected. The external
surface of many of the cysts is covered with similar granules, but some
are quite clean.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that these cysts represent a stage in the
life-history of some minute unicellular plant or animal. Indeed,
although it has not yet been found possible to work out this
life-history in detail, I have been able to obtain much evidence that
they are the resting stage of a flagellate organism allied to
<i>Euglena</i> which is swallowed by the polyzoon and becomes encysted
in its gizzard, extruding in so doing from its external surface a large
proportion of the food-material that it has stored up within itself in
the form of transparent granules. It may also be stated that some of the
organisms die and disintegrate on being received into the gizzard,
instead of encysting themselves.</p>

<p>So long as the gizzard retains its spherical form the green cells and
its other contents are prevented from entering the stomach by the
movements of the cilia that surround its lower aperture, but every now
and then, at irregular intervals, the muscles that form its outer wall
contract. The chitinous lining although resilient and not inflexible is
too stiff to prevent the lumen of the gizzard being obliterated, but the
action of the muscles changes its contents from a spherical to an ovoid
form and in so doing presses a considerable part of them down into the
stomach, through the ring of the cilia.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig_038.png"

<p class="caption">Fig. 38.&mdash;Optical section of gizzard of

</div>

<p>The contraction of the gizzard is momentary, and on its re-expansion
some of the green cysts that have entered the stomach are often
regurgitated into it. Some, however, remain in the stomach,<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span> in
which they are turned round and round by the action of the cilia at both
apertures. They are apparently able to retain their form for some hours
in these circumstances but finally disintegrate and disappear, being
doubtless digested by the juices poured out upon them by the glandular
lining of the stomach. In polypides kept under observation in clean
tap-water all the cysts finally disappear, and the fæces assume a green
colour. In preserved specimens apparently unaltered cysts are sometimes
found in the rectum, but this is exceptional: I have observed nothing of
the kind in living polypides. Cysts often remain for several days
unaltered in the gizzard.</p>

<p>Imperfect as these observations are, they throw considerable light on
the functions of the gizzard in <i>Hislopia</i>. Primarily it appears to
act as a food-reservoir in which the green cysts and other minute
organisms can be kept until they are required for digestion. When in the
gizzard certain organisms surrender a large proportion of the
food-material stored up for their own uses, and this food-material
doubtless aids in nourishing the polyzoon. Although the cysts in the
gizzard are frequently accompanied by diatoms, the latter are not
invariably present. The cysts, moreover, are to be found in the
zo&oelig;cia of polypides that have formed brown bodies, often being
actually enclosed in the substance of the brown body. The gizzards of
the specimens of <i>Arachnoidea</i> I have examined contain cysts that
resemble those found in the same position in <i>Hislopia</i>.</p>

<p><i>Hislopia</i> is widely distributed in the southern part of the
Oriental Region, and, if I am right in regarding <i>Echinella</i>,
Korotneff as a synonym, extends its range northwards to Lake Baikal. It
appears to be a highly specialized form but is perhaps related, through
<i>Arachnoidea</i>, to <i>Victorella</i>.</p>

<p><i>Zoarium.</i> The zoarium forms a flat, more or less solid layer
and is closely adherent to foreign objects. As a rule it covers a
considerable area, with radiating branches at the edges; but when
growing on slender twigs or the stems of water-plants it forms<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
narrow, closely compressed masses. One zo&oelig;cium, however, never
grows over another.</p>

<p><i>Zo&oelig;cia.</i> The zo&oelig;cia are variable in shape. In
zoaria which have space for free expansion they are as a rule
irregularly oval, the posterior extremity being often narrower than the
anterior; but small triangular zo&oelig;cia and others that are almost
square may often be found. When growing on a support of limited area the
zo&oelig;cia are smaller and as a rule more elongate. The orifice is
situated on a slight eminence nearer the anterior than the posterior
margin of the dorsal surface. It is surrounded by a strong chitinous
rim, which is usually square or subquadrate but not infrequently
circular or subcircular. Sometimes a prominent spine is borne at each
corner of the rim, but these spines are often vestigial or absent; they
are rarely as long as the transverse diameter of the orifice. The
zo&oelig;cium is usually surrounded by a chitinous margin, and outside
this margin there is often a greater or less extent of adherent
membrane. In some zo&oelig;cia the margin is obsolete or obsolescent.
The dorsal surface is of a glassy transparency but by no means soft.</p>

<i>Anodonta</i> shells on which there was plenty of room for growth,
resemble the confined phase of <i>H. lacustris</i> so far as the form of
their zo&oelig;cia and of the orifice is concerned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Geographical Distribution.</span>&mdash;The
typical form is common in northern India and occurs also in Lower Burma;
the subspecies <i>moniliformis</i> appears to be confined to Lower
Bengal, while the varieties <i>cambodgiensis</i> and <i>sinensis</i>
both occur in China, the former having been found also in Cambodia and
Siam. Indian and Burmese localities are:&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Bengal</span>, Calcutta (subsp. <i>moniliformis</i>);
Berhampur, Murshidabad district (<i>J. Robertson Milne</i>): <span
class="smcap">Central Provinces</span>, Nagpur (<i>Carter</i>): <span
class="smcap">United Provinces</span>, Bulandshahr (<i>H. J.
Walton</i>): <span class="smcap">Burma</span>, Pegu-Sittang Canal
(<i>Kirkpatrick</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Biology.</span>&mdash;Regarding the typical form
of the species Major Walton writes (Rec. Ind. Mus. iii, p.
296):&mdash;"In volume i (page 177) of the Records of the Indian Museum,
I described the two forms of colonies of <i>Hislopia</i> that I had
found in the United Provinces (Bulandshahr). Of these, one was a more or
less linear arrangement of the zo&oelig;cia on leaves and twigs, and the
other, and more common, form was an encrusting sheath on the outer
surface of the shells of <i>Paludina</i>. During the present 'rains'
(July 1908) I have found many examples of what may be considered a much
exaggerated extension of the latter form. These colonies have been on
bricks, tiles, and other submerged objects. The largest colony that I
have seen so far was on a tile; one side of the tile was exposed above
the mud of the bottom of the tank, and its area measured about 120
square inches; the entire surface was almost completely covered by a
continuous growth of <i>Hislopia</i>. Another large colony was on a
piece of bark which measured 7 inches by 3 inches; both sides were
practically everywhere covered by <i>Hislopia</i>."</p>

<p>Major Walton also notes that in the United Provinces the growth of
<i>Hislopia</i> is at its maximum during "rains," and that at that time
of year almost every adult <i>Paludina</i> in a certain<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
tank at Bulandshahr had its shell covered with the zo&oelig;cia. The
Calcutta race flourishes all the year round but never forms large or
closely compacted zoaria, those on shells of <i>Vivipara</i> exactly
resembling those on leaves of <i>Vallisneria</i>.</p>

<p>In Calcutta both eggs and spermatozoa are produced at all times of
the year simultaneously in the same zo&oelig;cia, but the eggs in one
zo&oelig;cium often vary greatly in size. When mature they reach
relatively considerable dimensions and contain a large amount of food
material; but they are set free from the zo&oelig;cium as eggs. They lie
loose in the zo&oelig;cium at a comparatively small size and grow in
this position. Nothing is known as regards the development of
<i>Hislopia</i>.</p>

<p>Both forms of the species appear to be confined to water that is free
from all traces of contamination with brine.</p>

<p class="p4 center larger">Order <b>PHYLACTOLÆMATA.</b><span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>The polypide in this order possesses a leaf-like ciliated organ (the
epistome) which arises within the lophophore between the mouth and the
anus and projects upwards and forwards over the mouth, which it can be
used to close. The zo&oelig;cia are never distinct from one another, but
in dendritic forms such as <i>Plumatella</i> the zoarium is divided at
irregular intervals by chitinous partitions. The lophophore in most
genera is horseshoe-shaped instead of circular, the part opposite the
anus being deeply indented. There are no parietal muscles. The orifice
of the zo&oelig;cium is always circular, and there is no trace of any
structure corresponding to the collar of the ctenostomes. The tentacles
are always webbed at the base.</p>

<p>All the phylactolæmata produce the peculiar reproductive bodies known
as statoblasts.</p>

<p>The phylactolæmata, which are probably descended from ctenostomatous
ancestors, are confined to fresh or slightly brackish water. Most of the
genera have a wide geographical distribution, but (with the exception of
a few statoblasts of almost recent date) only one fossil form
(<i>Plumatellites</i>, Fric. from the chalk of Bohemia) has been
referred to the order, and that with some doubt.</p>

<p>It is convenient to recognize two main divisions of the
phylactolæmata, but these divisions hardly merit the distinction of
being regarded as suborders. They may be called Cristatellina and
Plumatellina and distinguished as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Division I, <span class="smcap">Plumatellina</span>,
nov.&mdash;Ectocyst well developed; zoaria without a special organ of
progression; polypides contained in tubes.</p>

<p>Division II, <span class="smcap">Cristatellina</span>,
nov.&mdash;Ectocyst absent except at the base of the zoarium which is
modified to form a creeping "sole"; polypides embedded in a common
syn&oelig;cium of reticulate structure.</p>

<p>The Cristatellina consist of a single genus and probably of a single
species (<i>Cristatella mucedo</i>, Cuvier), which is widely distributed
in Europe and N. America, but has not been found in the Oriental Region.
Eight genera of Plumatellina are known, and five (possibly six) of these
genera occur in India.</p>

<p class="p2 center">Division PLUMATELLINA, nov.</p>

<p>The structure of the species included in this division is very
uniform as regards the internal organs (see fig. 40 opposite and fig. 47
<i>a</i>, p.&nbsp;236). The alimentary canal is simpler than that of the
Paludicellidæ. A short &oelig;sophagus leads directly into the
stomach,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg
207]</a></span> the cardiac portion of which is produced as a vertical
limb almost cylindrical in form and not constricted at the base. This
limb is as a rule of greater length than the &oelig;sophagus. The
pyloric part of the stomach is elongated and narrow, and the intestine
short, straight, and of ovoid form. There are no cilia at the pyloric
opening. A single funiculus joins the posterior end of the stomach to
the wall of the zo&oelig;cium, bearing the statoblasts. Sexual organs
are often absent.</p>

<p>Two families may be recognized as constituting the division,

oval lophophore and simple statoblast without a swim-ring, and
(<i>b</i>) the Plumatellidæ, in which the lophophore is shaped like a
horseshoe and some or all of the statoblasts are provided with a ring of
air-spaces.</p>

<p>This genus has the characters of the family. Its status has been much
disputed, some authors regarding the shape of the lophophore as of great
morphological importance, while Jullien believed that
<i>Fredericella</i> was merely an abnormal or monstrous form of
<i>Plumatella</i>. The latter belief was doubtless due to the fact that
the zoaria of the two genera bear a very close external resemblance to
one another and are sometimes found entangled together. The importance
of the shape of the lophophore may, however, easily be exaggerated, for,
as both Jullien and Goddard have pointed out, it assumes an emarginate
form when retracted.</p>

<p>The best known species is the European and N. American <i>F.
sultana</i> (Blumenbach), of which several varieties or phases have been
described as distinct. This form is stated to occur also in S. Africa.
<i>F. australiensis</i>, Goddard<a name="fnanchor_BC"
id="fnanchor_BC"></a><a href="#footnote_BC"
class="fnanchor"><sup>[BC]</sup></a> from N. S. Wales is said to differ
from this species in having an oval instead of a circular lophophore and
in other small anatomical characters; but it is doubtful how far these
characters are valid, for the lophophore appears to be capable of
changing its shape to some slight extent and has been stated by Jullien
to be habitually oval in specimens from France. <i>F. cunningtoni</i>,
Rousselet<a name="fnanchor_BD" id="fnanchor_BD"></a><a
href="#footnote_BD" class="fnanchor"><sup>[BD]</sup></a> from Lake
Tanganyika has stout zo&oelig;cia encrusted with relatively large
sand-grains.</p>

<p>The zoaria of <i>Fredericella</i> are usually found attached to solid
objects in shallow water, but a form described as <i>F. duplessisi</i>,
Ford has been found at a depth of 40 fathoms embedded in mud at the
bottom of the Lake of Geneva. <i>F. cunningtoni</i> was dredged from
depths of about 10 and about 25 fathoms.</p>

<p>The statoblasts of this genus do not float and often germinate in the
parent zo&oelig;cium after its polypides have died. They are produced in
smaller numbers than is usually the case in other genera of the order.
The polypides sometimes undergo a process of regeneration, but without
the formation of brown bodies.</p>

<p><i>Zoarium.</i> The zoarium is of delicate appearance and branches
sparingly. It is often entirely recumbent but sometimes produces short,
lax branches that consist of two or three zo&oelig;cia only.</p>

<p><i>Zo&oelig;cia.</i> The zo&oelig;cia are very slender and almost
cylindrical; they are slightly emarginate and furrowed, the keel in
which the furrow runs being sometimes prominent. The external surface is
minutely roughened and apparently soft, for small grains of sand and
other débris cling to it, but never thickly. The ectocyst is practically
colourless but not transparent.</p>

<p><i>Statoblasts.</i> The statoblasts are variable in size and form but
most commonly have a regular broad oval outline; sometimes they are
kidney-shaped. The dorsal surface is covered with minute star-shaped
prominences, which sometimes cover it almost uniformly and are sometimes
more numerous in the centre than towards the periphery. The ventral
surface is smooth.</p>

<p><i>Polypide.</i> The lophophore bears about 20-25 tentacles, which
are very slender and of moderate length; the velum at their base is
narrow; as a rule the lophophore is accurately circular.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Type</span> in the Indian Museum.</p>

<p>The most definite character in which this species differs from <i>F.
sultana</i> and <i>F. australiensis</i> is the ornamentation of one
surface of the statoblast, both surfaces of which are smooth in the two
latter species. From <i>F. cunningtoni</i>, the statoblasts of which are
unknown, it differs in having almost cylindrical instead of depressed
zo&oelig;cia and in not having the zo&oelig;cia densely covered with
sand-grains.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Geographical Distribution.</span>&mdash;Western
India (the Malabar Zone): Igatpuri Lake, W. Ghats (alt. ca. 2,000 feet),
Bombay Presidency, and Shasthancottah Lake near Quilon, Travancore.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Biology.</span>&mdash;In both the lakes in which
the species has yet been found it was collected in November. The
specimens obtained in Travancore were found to be undergoing a process
of regeneration due at least partly to the fact that most of the
polypides had perished and that statoblasts were germinating in the old
zo&oelig;cia. Specimens from the Bombay Presidency, which were obtained
a little later in the month, were in a more vigorous condition, although
even they contained many young polypides that were not yet fully formed.
It seems, therefore, not improbable that <i>F. indica</i> dies down at
the beginning of the hot weather and is regenerated by the germination
of its statoblasts at the beginning of the cold weather.</p>

<p>At Shasthancottah zoaria were found entangled with zoaria of a
delicate form of <i>Plumatella fruticosa</i> to which they bore a very
close external resemblance.</p>

well-developed ectocyst not specialized to form an organ of progression.
Some or all of the statoblasts are provided with a "swim-ring"
consisting of symmetrically disposed, polygonal chitinous chambers
containing air.</p>

<p>It is convenient to divide the Plumatellidæ as thus defined into

<p>Zoarium forming a gelatinous mass in which the tubular nature of the
zo&oelig;cia almost disappears, capable to a limited extent of

this subfamily are often found in close proximity to one another and to

<p>Certain forms of this genus are liable to become compacted together
in such a way as to constitute solid masses consisting of elongate
vertical zo&oelig;cia closely parallel to one another and sometimes
agglutinated by means of a gummy substance. These forms were given by
Lamarck in 1816 the name <i>Alcyonella</i>, and there has been much
dispute as to whether they represent a distinct genus, distinct species,
or merely varieties or phases of more typical forms. It appears to be
the case that all species which produce vertical branches are liable to
have these branches closely packed together and the individual
zo&oelig;cia of which they are composed more or less greatly elongated.
It is in this way that the form known to Allman as <i>Alcyonella
benedeni</i> is produced from the typical <i>Plumatella emarginata</i>.
Other forms go further and secrete a gummy substance that glues the
upright zo&oelig;cia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214"
id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span> together and forces them to elongate
themselves without branching. In these conditions the zo&oelig;cia
become polygonal in cross-section. It is probable that such forms
(<i>e.&nbsp;g.</i>, <i>Plumatella fungosa</i> (Pallas)) should rank as
distinct species, for the gummy secretion is present in great profusion
even in young zoaria in which the zo&oelig;cia have not yet assumed a
vertical position. No such form, however, has as yet been found in
India, and in any case it is impossible to regard <i>Alcyonella</i> as a
distinct genus.</p>

<p>There has always been much difficulty in separating the species of
<i>Plumatella</i>, and even now there is no general consensus of<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
opinion as to the number that should be recognized. The difficulty,
however, is much reduced if the following precautions are
observed:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote_b">(1) If the zoarium appears to be tangled, if the
branches intertwine or overlap, or if the zo&oelig;cia are closely
pressed together, the whole mass should be carefully dissected out. This
is necessary not only because zoaria belonging to different species are
sometimes found entangled together but also because it is often
difficult to recognize the characteristic method of branching and shape
of the zo&oelig;cia unless it is done.</p>

<p class="blockquote_b">(2) As large a part as possible of each zoarium
should be examined, preferably with a binocular microscope, and
allowance should be made for irregularities and abnormalities of all
kinds. What must be observed is the rule rather than the exceptions.</p>

<p class="blockquote_b">(3) When the statoblasts are being examined,
care must be taken that they lie flat and that their surface is parallel
to that of the nose-piece of the microscope. If they are viewed
obliquely it is impossible to see their true outlines and
proportions.</p>

<p class="blockquote_b">(4) In order to see the relative proportions of
the capsule and the swim-ring it is necessary that the statoblast should
be rendered transparent. This is often difficult owing to the presence
of air in the air-cells, but strong nitric acid applied judiciously will
render it possible (p. <a href="#Page_240">240</a>).</p>

<p>In supervising the preparation of the plates that illustrate this
genus I have impressed upon the artist the importance of representing
what he saw rather than what he thought he ought to see, and the figures
are very close copies of actual specimens. I have deliberately chosen
for representation specimens of <i>Plumatella</i> preserved by the
simple methods which are often the only ones that it is possible for a
traveller to adopt, for the great majority of naturalists will probably
have no opportunity of examining living specimens or specimens preserved
by special methods, and the main object, I take it, of this series is to
enable naturalists first to distinguish the species described and then
to learn something of their habitat and habits.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Geographical Distribution.</span>&mdash;Of the
seven species included in this key five have been found in Europe
(namely <i>P. fruticosa</i>, <i>P. emarginata</i>, <i>P. diffusa</i>,
<i>P. allmani</i>, and <i>P. punctata</i>), while of these five all but
<i>P. allmani</i> are known to occur in N. America also. <i>P.
javanica</i> is apparently peculiar to the Oriental Region, while <i>P.
tanganyikæ</i> has only been taken in Central Africa and in the Bombay
Presidency.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Types.</span>&mdash;Very few of the
type-specimens of the older species of <i>Plumatella</i> are in
existence. Allman's are neither in Edinburgh nor in London, and Mr. E.
Leonard Gill, who has been kind enough to go through the Hancock
Collection at Newcastle-on-Tyne, tells me that he cannot trace
Hancock's. Those of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216"
id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span> forms described by Kraepelin are in
Hamburg and that of <i>P. tanganyikæ</i> in the British Museum, and
there are schizotypes or paratypes of this species and of <i>P.
javanica</i> in Calcutta. The types of Leidy's species were at one time
in the collection of the Philadelphia Academy of Science.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Biology.</span>&mdash;The zoaria of the species
of <i>Plumatella</i> are found firmly attached to stones, bricks, logs
of wood, sticks, floating seeds, the stems and roots of water-plants,
and occasionally to the shells of molluscs such as <i>Vivipara</i> and
<i>Unio</i>. Some species shun the light, but all are apparently
confined to shallow water.</p>

<p>Various small oligochæte worms (e.&nbsp;g., <i>Chætogaster
spongillæ</i>,<a name="fnanchor_BG" id="fnanchor_BG"></a><a
href="#footnote_BG" class="fnanchor"><sup>[BG]</sup></a> <i>Nais
obtusa</i>, <i>Nais elinguis</i>, <i>Slavina appendiculata</i> and
<i>Pristina longiseta</i><a name="fnanchor_BH" id="fnanchor_BH"></a><a
href="#footnote_BH" class="fnanchor"><sup>[BH]</sup></a>), take shelter
amongst them; dipterous larvæ of the genus <i>Chironomus</i> often build
their protective tubes at the base of the zoaria, and the surface of the
zo&oelig;cia commonly bears a more or less profuse growth of such
protozoa as <i>Vorticella</i> and <i>Epistylis</i>. I have seen a worm
of the genus <i>Chætogaster</i> devouring the tentacles of a polypide
that had been accidentally injured, but as a rule the movements of the
lophophore are too quick to permit attacks of the kind, and I know of no
active enemy of the genus. The growth of sponges at the base of the
zoaria probably chokes some species, but one form (<i>F. fruticosa</i>)
is able to surmount this difficulty by elongating its zo&oelig;cia
(p.&nbsp;219). A small worm (<i>Aulophorus tonkinensis</i>) which is
common in ponds in Burma and the east of India as far west as Lucknow,
often builds the tube in which it lives mainly of the free statoblasts
of this genus. It apparently makes no selection in so doing but merely
gathers the commonest and lightest objects it can find, for small seeds
and minute fragments of wood as well as sponge gemmules and statoblasts
of other genera are also collected by it. I know of no better way of
obtaining a general idea as to what sponges and phylactolæmata are
present in a pond than to examine the tubes of <i>Aulophorus
tonkinensis</i>.</p>

<p>I am indebted to Mr. F. H. Gravely, Assistant Superintendent in the
Indian Museum, for an interesting note regarding the food of
<i>Plumatella</i>. His observations, which were made in
Northamptonshire, were unfortunately interrupted at a critical moment,
but I have reproduced them with his consent in order that other
observers may investigate the phenomena he saw. Mr. Gravely noted that a
small green flagellate which was abundant in water in which
<i>Plumatella repens</i> was growing luxuriantly, was swallowed by the
polypides, and that if the polyparium was kept in a shallow dish of
water, living flagellata of the same species congregated in a little
pile under the anus of each polypide. His preparations show very clearly
that the flagellates were passing through the alimentary canal without
apparent change, but the method of<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span> preservation does not
permit the retractile granules, which were present in large numbers in
the cell-substance of the flagellates, to be displayed and it is
possible that these granules had disappeared from those flagellates
which are present in the recta of his specimens. It is clear, therefore,
either that certain flagellates must pass through the alimentary canal
of <i>Plumatella</i> unchanged, or that the polyzoon must have the power
of absorbing the stored food material the flagellates contain without
doing them any other injury.</p>

<p>The free statoblasts of <i>Plumatella</i> are as a rule set free
before the cells they contain become differentiated, and float on the
surface of the water for some time before they germinate; but
occasionally a small polypide is formed inside the capsule while it is
still in its parent zo&oelig;cium. I have, however, seen only one
instance of this premature development, in a single statoblast contained
in a small zoarium of <i>P. fruticosa</i> found in Lower Burma in March.
The fixed statoblasts usually remain fixed to the support of the
zoarium, even when their parent-zo&oelig;cium decays, and germinate
<i>in situ</i>.</p>

<p>The larva (fig. 40 C, p.&nbsp;207) that originates from the egg of
<i>Plumatella</i> is a minute pear-shaped, bladder-like body covered
externally with fine vibratile threads (cilia) and having a pore at the
narrow end. At the period at which it is set free from the parent
zo&oelig;cium it already contains a fully formed polypide or pair of
polypides with the tentacles directed towards the narrow end. After a
brief period of active life, during which it moves through the water by
means of its cilia, it settles down on its broad end, which becomes
adhesive; the polypide or pair of polypides is everted through the pore
at the narrow end, the whole of this end is turned inside out, and a
fresh polyparium is rapidly formed by budding.</p>

<p><i>Zoarium.</i> The zoarium in the typical form has a loose
appearance due to the fact that the branches are far apart and the
ectocyst by no means rigid. When young the zoarium is adherent, but in
well-grown polyparia vertical branches, often an inch or more in length,
are freely produced. As a rule they have not the strength to stand
upright if removed from the water. Branching is ordinarily lateral and
as a rule occurs chiefly on one side of a main branch or trunk. In
certain circumstances upright zo&oelig;cia are pressed together and
reach a great length without branching, and in this form (<i>P.
coralloides</i>, Allman) daughter-zo&oelig;cia are often produced at the
tip of an elongated mother-zo&oelig;cium in fan-like formation. A
depauperated form (<i>P. stricta</i>, Allman), occurs in which the
vertical branches are absent or very short. In all forms internal
partitions are numerous and stout.</p>

<p><i>Zo&oelig;cia.</i> The zo&oelig;cia are cylindrical and bear a
simple keel on their dorsal surface. They are never emarginate or
furrowed. In the typical form their diameter is more than half a
millimetre, and they are always of considerable length. The ectocyst is
thin and never very rigid or deeply pigmented, the colour usually being
an almost uniform pale pinkish brown and fading little towards the tip
of the zo&oelig;cium.</p>

<p><i>Statoblasts.</i> Both free and stationary statoblasts are formed,
but the latter are rare and do not always adhere. They resemble the free
statoblasts in general form but have a solid margin instead of a
swim-ring and are often minutely serrated round the edge. The free
statoblasts are at least considerably, sometimes very elongate; in all
zoaria it is possible to find specimens that are more than twice as long
as broad. The capsule is relatively large and resembles the swim-ring in
outline, so that the free portion of the latter is not much narrower at
the sides than at the ends. The sides are distinctly convex and the ends
rounded; the swim-ring encroaches little on the surface of the
capsule.</p>

<p><i>Polypide.</i> The tentacles number between 40 and 50 and are not
festooned at the base. The stomach is slender and elongate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Type</span> not in existence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Systematic Remarks.</span>&mdash;<i>P.
fruticosa</i> is closely allied to <i>P. repens</i> (European and N.
American) but always has much longer statoblasts. Three phases of the
species may be distinguished as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote_b">A. (<i>Forma typica</i>). Zo&oelig;cia stout in
form, not greatly elongate; free branches produced in profusion.</p>

<p class="blockquote_b">B. (<i>P. stricta</i>, Allman, <i>P. repens</i>,
van Beneden). Zo&oelig;cia slender; free branches absent or consisting
of two or three zo&oelig;cia only.</p>

<p class="blockquote_b">C. (<i>P. coralloides</i>, Allman). Vertical
zo&oelig;cia pressed together and greatly elongated.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg
219]</a></span>Indian specimens of the typical form agree well with
German specimens labelled by Prof. Kraepelin <i>P. princeps</i> var.
<i>fruticosa</i>, and specimens of the <i>coralloides</i> phase could
hardly be distinguished from similar specimens from Scotland.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Geographical Distribution.</span>&mdash;<i>P.
fruticosa</i> is widely distributed in Europe and probably in N.
America. I have seen Indian specimens from the Punjab (Lahore,
<i>Stephenson</i>), from Bombay, from Travancore, from Calcutta and
other places in the Ganges delta, from Rajshahi (Rampur Bhoolia) on the
R. Ganges, from Kurseong in the E. Himalayas (alt. 4,500 feet), and from
Kawkareik in Tenasserim. Statoblasts found on the surface of a pond near
Simla in the W. Himalayas (alt. <i>ca.</i> 8,000 feet), probably belong
to this species.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Biology.</span>&mdash;Allman states that in
England <i>P. fruticosa</i> is fond of still and slowly-running water.
The typical form and the <i>coralloides</i> phase grow abundantly in the
Calcutta tanks, the former often attaining an extraordinary luxuriance.
I have found the var. <i>stricta</i> only in water in which there was
reason to suspect a lack of minute life (and therefore of food), viz. in
Shasthancottah Lake in Travancore, in a swamp in Lower Burma, and in a
small jungle stream near the base of the Western Ghats in Travancore.
The species is the only one that I have seen in running water in India,
and the specimens obtained in the jungle stream in Travancore are the
only specimens I have taken in these circumstances. <i>P. fruticosa</i>
always grows near the surface or near the edge of water; it is found
attached to the stems of bulrushes and other aquatic plants, to floating
seeds and logs and (rarely) to stones and bricks. So far as my
experience goes it is only found, at any rate in Calcutta, in the cold
weather and does not make its appearance earlier than October.</p>

<p>The form Allman called <i>P. coralloides</i> was found by him,
"attached to floating logs of wood, together with <i>P. repens</i> and
<i>Cordylophora lacustris</i>, and generally immersed in masses of
<i>Spongilla fluviatilis</i>." I have always found it immersed in
sponges (<i>S. lacustris</i>, <i>S. alba</i>, <i>S. carteri</i>, and
<i>S. crassissima</i>), except when the sponge in which it had been
immersed had decayed. Indeed, the peculiar form it has assumed appears
to be directly due to the pressure of the growing sponge exerted on the
zo&oelig;cia, for it is often possible to find a zoarium that has been
partially overgrown by a sponge and has retained its typical form so
long as it was free but has assumed the <i>coralloides</i> form where
immersed.<a name="fnanchor_BI" id="fnanchor_BI"></a><a

</div>

<p><i>Zoarium.</i> The zoarium often covers a considerable area on flat
surfaces and is sometimes entirely recumbent. More usually, however, the
younger part is vertical. In either case the branching is practically
dichotomous, two young zo&oelig;cia arising almost simultaneously at the
tip of a mother-zo&oelig;cium and diverging from one another at a small
angle. When the zoarium becomes vertical, rigid branches of as much as
an inch in length are sometimes produced in this way and, arising
parallel to one another, are pressed together to form an almost solid
mass (=<i>Alcyonella benedeni</i>, Allman). In such cases the basal
zo&oelig;cium or at any rate the basal part of each upright branch is
considerably elongated. In recumbent zo&oelig;cia the main branches
often radiate outwards from a common centre.</p>

<p><i>Zo&oelig;cia.</i> The zo&oelig;cia are of almost equal width
throughout, slender, and moderately elongate when recumbent. Their
ectocyst is stiff; they are emarginate at the tip and more or less
distinctly furrowed on the dorsal surface, the keel in which the furrow
runs not being prominent. The orifice is often on the dorsal surface
even in upright branches. Each zo&oelig;cium is of a dark brown or
almost black colour for the greater part of its length but has a
conspicuous white tip which is extended down the dorsal surface in the
form of a triangle, its limits being rather more extensive than and
parallel to those of the emargination.</p>

<p><i>Statoblast.</i> The majority of the free statoblasts are elongate
and truncate or subtruncate at the extremities, the sides being as a
rule straight and parallel. In every polyparium specimens will be found
that are between twice and thrice as long as broad. The capsule is,
however, relatively much broader than the swim-ring,<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
often being nearly circular, and there is therefore at either end a
considerable extent of free air-cells, while the extent of these cells
at the sides of the capsule is small. The air-cells cover a considerable
part of the dorsal surface of the capsule. Fixed statoblasts are usually
found in old colonies, especially at the approach of the hot weather.
They have an oval form and are surrounded by a membranous margin on
which traces of reticulation can often be detected. As a rule
statoblasts of both types are produced in considerable but not in
excessive numbers.</p>

<p><i>Polypide.</i> There are about 40 tentacles, the velum at the base
of which extends upwards for a considerable distance without being
festooned. The stomach is elongate and slender and narrowly rounded at
the base.</p>

<p>The method of branching, the coloration of the zo&oelig;cia and the
form of the free statoblast are all characteristic. Luxuriant or closely
compressed zoaria of <i>P. diffusa</i> often bear a superficial
resemblance to those of <i>P. emarginata</i>, but the resemblance
disappears if they are carefully dissected out. Indian specimens of
<i>P. emarginata</i> agree closely with European ones.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Geographical Distribution.</span>&mdash;<i>P.
emarginata</i> is a common species in Europe, N. America, and southern
Asia and probably also occurs in Africa and Australia. I have examined
specimens from Calcutta, Rangoon, and Mandalay in Indian territory, and
also from Jalor in the Patani States (Malay Peninsula) and the Talé Noi,
Lakon Sitamarat, Lower Siam. Gemmules found by Apstein (Zool. Jahrb.
(Syst.) xxv, 1907, p.&nbsp;201) in plankton from the Colombo lake may
belong to this species or to any of the others included by Kraepelin in
his <i>P. princeps</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Biology.</span>&mdash;In Ireland Allan found
<i>P. emarginata</i> in streams and rivulets, but it also occurs in
European lakes. In India I have only found it in ponds. It prefers to
adhere to the surface of stones or bricks, but when these are not
available is found on the stems of water-plants. In the latter position
the form called <i>Alcyonella benedeni</i> by Allman is usually
produced, owing to the fact that the upright branches are crowded
together through lack of space, very much in the same way (although
owing to a different cause) as those of <i>P. fruticosa</i> are crowded
together in the <i>coralloides</i> phase, to which the <i>benedeni</i>
phase of <i>P. emarginata</i> is in many respects analogous.</p>

<p>Although it is essentially a cold-weather species in Calcutta, <i>P.
emarginata</i> is sometimes found in a living condition during the
"rains." Zoaria examined at this season, however, contains few living
polypides, the majority of the zo&oelig;cia having rotted away and left
fixed statoblasts only to mark their former position.</p>

<p>This species is related to <i>P. emarginata</i>, from which it may be
distinguished by the following characters:&mdash;

<i>Zoarium.</i> The zoarium is always entirely recumbent and branches
sparingly; its method of branching does not approach the dichotomous
type but is lateral and irregular. Linear series of zo&oelig;cia without
lateral branches are often formed.</p>

<p><i>Zo&oelig;cia.</i> The zo&oelig;cia are slender and often very
long; they are strongly emarginate and furrowed, and the keel that
contains the furrow is conspicuous. The ectocyst is hyaline and as a
rule absolutely colourless.</p>

<p><i>Statoblasts.</i> The free statoblasts are variable in length,
sometimes distinctly elongate, sometimes elongate only to a moderate
degree; they are rounded at the extremities and have the sides slightly
or distinctly convex outwards. The capsule is relatively large, and the
free portion of the swim-ring is not much broader at the ends than at
the sides. The fixed statoblasts are elongate and surrounded by an
irregularly shaped chitinous membrane, which is often of considerable
extent. The whole of the dorsal surface is covered with what appear to
be rudimentary air-spaces some of which even contain air.</p>

<p>The transparent glassy ectocyst and strong furrowed keel of this
species are very characteristic, but the former character is apt to be
obscured by staining due to external causes, especially when the zoarium
is attached to dead wood. The shape of the free statoblasts is too
variable to be regarded as a good diagnostic character, but the fixed
statoblasts, when they are to be found, are very characteristic in
appearance. <i>P. javanica</i> appears to be closely related to Allman's
<i>P. dumortieri</i>, with which stained zoaria are apt to be confused.
The character of the ectocyst is, however, different, and the free part
of the swim-ring is distinctly narrower at the sides of the free
statoblasts. Dr. Kraepelin has been kind enough to send me one of the
types.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Biology.</span>&mdash;Very little is known about
the biology of this species. Kraepelin took it in Java on the leaves of
water-lilies. It is not uncommon during the cold weather in the Calcutta
Zoological Gardens on floating seeds and sticks and on the stems of
bulrushes; in Travancore I took it in November on the submerged leaves
of <i>Pandani</i> growing at the edge of a canal of<span

slightly brackish water. Mr. Hodgart, the collector of the Indian
Museum, found it in the R. Jharai on the stems of water-plants at a time
of flood in the "rains." In Calcutta it is often found entangled with
<i>P. fruticosa</i> and <i>P. emarginata</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Zoarium.</i> The zoarium often covers a considerable area on flat
surfaces and is sometimes found crowded together on the stems of plants.
In the latter case the arrangement of the main branches is distinctly
radiate. Upright branches occur rarely and never consist of more than
three zo&oelig;cia. The characteristic method of branching is best
represented by the following diagram:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter">

width="223" height="72"  alt="Illustration: Fig. 43." title="Fig. 43."
/>
<p class="caption">Fig. 43.</p>
</div>

<p>The partitions are stout and numerous.</p>

<p><i>Zo&oelig;cia.</i> The great majority of the zo&oelig;cia in each
zoarium are distinctly <b>L</b>-shaped, the long limb being usually
adherent. The vital organs of the polypide are contained in the vertical
limb, while the horizontal one, in mature polyparia, is packed full of
free statoblasts. The zo&oelig;cia are cylindrical and as a rule
obscurely emarginate and furrowed. The ectocyst is stiff; it is never
deeply pigmented but is usually of a transparent horn-colour at the base
of each zo&oelig;cium and colourless at the tip, the contrast between
the two portions never being very strong. The basal portion is rough on
the surface, the distal portion smooth.</p>

<p><i>Statoblasts.</i> Free statoblasts are produced in very great
profusion and fixed statoblasts are also to be found as a rule. The
latter resemble those of <i>P. emarginata</i>. The free statoblasts are
never very large or relatively broad, but they vary considerably as
regards size and outline. The capsule is large, the sides convex
outwards and the extremity more or less broadly rounded. The air-cells
are unusually large and extend over a great part of the dorsal surface
of the statoblast.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg
224]</a></span><i>Polypide.</i> The polypide is shorter and stouter than
that of <i>P. emarginata</i> and as a rule has fewer tentacles.</p>

<p>The most characteristic feature of this species is the form of the
zo&oelig;cia, which differ greatly from those of any other Indian
species but <i>P. allmani</i>. In the latter they are distinctly
"keg-shaped" (<i>i. e.</i>, constricted at the base and swollen in the
middle), and the zoarium never spreads out over large surfaces in the
way in which that of <i>P. diffusa</i> does.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Type</span>&mdash;? in the Philadelphia Academy
of Sciences.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Geographical Distribution.</span>&mdash;This
species was originally described from North America (in which it is
apparently common) and occurs also in Europe. I have seen Indian
specimens from the following localities:&mdash;<span
class="smcap">Bengal</span>, Calcutta and neighbourhood; Rajshahi
(Rampur Bhulia): <span class="smcap">E. Himalayas</span>, Gangtok,
Native Sikhim (alt. 6,150 feet) (<i>Kirkpatrick</i>, <i>Stewart</i>):
<span class="smcap">Punjab</span>, Lahore (<i>Stephenson</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Biology.</span>&mdash;<i>P. diffusa</i> in Lower
Bengal is a cold-weather species. It is remarkable for the enormous
number of gemmules it produces and is usually found either on floating
objects such as the stems of certain water-plants, or on stones or
bricks at the edge of ponds.</p>

<p>This species is closely allied to <i>P. diffusa</i>, from which it
differs in the following characters:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote_b">(1) The zoarium never covers a large area and as
a rule grows sparingly and mainly in two directions.</p>

<p class="blockquote_b">(2) The zo&oelig;cia are more irregular in
shape, not so distinctly elbowed, smaller; they have a much more
prominently keeled ridge. The great majority of them are constricted at
the base and taper towards the orifice. In young zoaria they are almost
colourless but in older ones there is a band of not very dense pigment
round the base of the vertical limb.</p>

<p class="blockquote_b">(3) The free statoblasts are comparatively large
and usually show a tendency to taper at the extremities, often being
almost rhomboidal in form. The swim-ring does not extend so far over the
dorsal surface as it does in those of <i>P. diffusa</i>; the "cells" of
which it is composed are small.</p>

Allman's <i>P. elegans</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Geographical Distribution.</span>&mdash;<i>P.
allmani</i> is apparently a rare species to which there are few
references in literature. It was originally described from England and
is stated by Jullien to occur in France. I have found specimens only in
the lake Bhim Tal (alt. 4,500 feet) in the W. Himalayas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Biology.</span>&mdash;The original specimens were
found by Hancock on stones. My own were growing on the leaves of
water-plants, usually on the under side. When the zo&oelig;cia were
forced to stretch across from one leaflet to another they assumed the
sinuous form characteristic of Allman's <i>P. elegans</i>.</p>

<p><i>Zoarium.</i> The whole colony is recumbent but branches freely and
at short intervals in a horizontal plane, so that the zo&oelig;cia
become crowded together and the branches sometimes overlap one another.
The zoarium often covers a considerable area, but growth seems to be
mainly in two directions. When growing on the stems of water-plants the
branches are often parallel and closely pressed together but remain
recumbent in this position. A stout membrane sometimes extends between
branches and individual zo&oelig;cia.</p>

<p><i>Zo&oelig;cia.</i> The walls of the zo&oelig;cia are thick, stiff,
and more or less darkly but not opaquely pigmented; the external
surface, although not very smooth, is always clean. The two most
noteworthy characters of the zo&oelig;cia are (i) their truncated
appearance when the polypide is retracted, and (ii) the conspicuous,
although often irregular external annulation of their walls. The tip of
each zo&oelig;cium, owing to the fact that the invaginated part of the
ectocyst is soft and sharply separated from the stiffened wall of the
tube, terminates abruptly and is not rounded off gradually as is the
case in most species of the genus; sometimes it expands into a
trumpet-like mouth. The annulation of the external surface is due to
numerous thickened areas of the ectocyst which take the form of slender
rings surrounding the zo&oelig;cium; they are most conspicuous on its
distal half. On the dorsal surface of the base of each zo&oelig;cium
there is a conspicuous furrowed keel, which, however, does not usually
extend to the distal end; the latter is oval in cross-section. The
zo&oelig;cia are short and broad; their base is always recumbent, and,
when the zoarium is attached to a stone or shell, often seems to be
actually embedded in the support; the distal part turns upwards and is
free, so that the aperture is terminal; the zo&oelig;cia of the older
parts of the zoarium<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226"
id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span> exhibit the specific characters much
more clearly than those at the growing points.</p>

<p><i>Polypide.</i> The lophophore bears 20 to 30 tentacles, which are
long and slender; the velum at their base extends up each tentacle in
the form of a sharply pointed projection, but these projections do not
extend for more than one-fifth of the length of the tentacles. Both the
velum and the tentacular sheath bear numerous minute tubercles on the
external surface. The base of the stomach is rounded, and the whole of
the alimentary canal has a stout appearance.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg

produced, but not in very large numbers. The latter are broadly oval and
are surrounded by a stout chitinous ring, which often possesses
irregular membranous projections; the surface is smooth. The free
statoblasts are small and moderately elongate, the maximum breadth as a
rule measuring about 2/3 of the length; the capsule is relatively large
and the ring of air-cells is not very much broader at the ends than at
the sides; the dorsal surface of the central capsule is profusely
tuberculate. The outline of the whole structure is often somewhat
irregular.</p>

<p>In deference to Mr. Rousselet's opinion expressed in a letter I have
hitherto regarded the Bombay form of this species as distinct from the
African one, and there certainly is a great difference in the appearance
of specimens taken on the lower surface of stones in Igatpuri Lake and
of the types of <i>P. tanganyikæ</i>, one of which is now in the
collection of the Indian Museum. The dark colour of the former, however,
and their vigorous growth appear to be directly due to environment, for
these characters disappear to a large extent in specimens growing on the
stems of water-plants in the same lake. Indeed, such specimens are
exactly intermediate between the form "<i>bombayensis</i>" and the
typical form of the species. <i>P. tanganyikæ</i> is closely allied to
<i>P. philippinensis</i>, Kraepelin, from the island of Luzon, but the
latter has a smooth and polished ectocyst devoid of annulations, and
zo&oelig;cia of a more elongate and regular form.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Types</span> of the species in the British and

and from Igatpuri in the Bombay Presidency.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Biology.</span>&mdash;In both localities the
zoaria were found in shallow water. In L. Tanganyika they were
encrusting stones and shells, while at Igatpuri they were fixed for the
most part to the lower surface of stones but were also found on the
stems of water-plants. My specimens from the Bombay Presidency were
taken, on two separate occasions, at the end of November. At that date
the zoaria were already decaying and large blanks, marked out by fixed
statoblasts, were often observed on the stones. Probably, therefore, the
species flourishes during the "rains."</p>

<p class="p2"><i>Zoarium.</i> The zoarium is entirely recumbent and
often appears to form an almost uniform flat layer instead of a
dendritic body. Sometimes, however, it is distinctly linear, with
lateral branches produced irregularly at considerable distances
apart.</p>

<p><i>Zo&oelig;cia.</i> The zo&oelig;cia differ from those of all other
species in having a greatly swollen, soft ectocyst which can be
transversely wrinkled all over the zo&oelig;cium by the action of the
muscles of the polypide and is distinctly contractile. It is mainly
owing to the swollen and almost gelatinous nature of the ectocyst that
the dendritic character of the zoarium is frequently concealed, for the
method of branching is essentially the same as that of <i>P.
diffusa</i>, although the zo&oelig;cia are not so distinctly elbowed.
The ectocyst is colourless or faintly tinted with brown; as a rule it is
not quite hyaline and the external surface is minutely roughened or
tuberculate. The zo&oelig;cia are not emarginate or furrowed.</p>

<p><i>Statoblasts.</i> Stationary statoblasts are not found.  The free
statoblasts are variable and often asymmetrical in outline, but the free
portion of the swim-ring is always of nearly equal diameter all round
the periphery and the capsule relatively large. Some of the statoblasts
are always broad in comparison with their length.</p>

<p><i>Polypide.</i> The polypide is comparatively short and stout.
European specimens are said to have from 30 to 40 tentacles, but Indian
specimens have only from 20 to 30.</p>

<p>Shrunken specimens of the less congested forms of this species
closely resemble specimens of <i>P. repens</i>, but the statoblasts are
more variable in shape and the ectocyst, even in such specimens, is
thicker. Living or well-preserved specimens cannot be mistaken for those
of any other species. Jullien regarded <i>P. punctata</i> as the type of
a distinct genus (<i>Hyalinella</i>) but included in <i>Plumatella</i>
at least one form (P. "<i>arethusa</i>") which probably belongs to this
species. Kraepelin distinguishes as "varieties" two phases, a summer
phase ("var. <i>prostrata</i>") and an autumn phase ("var.
<i>densa</i>"). The former often forms linear series of considerable
length with only an occasional side-branch, while in the autumn phase
branching is so profuse and the branches are so closely pressed together
that the zoarium comes to resemble a uniform gelatinous patch rather
than a dendritic growth. A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229"
id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span> phase resembling the European autumn
form is the commonest in Calcutta and I have also found one intermediate
between this and Kraepelin's "var. <i>prostrata</i>," neither having any
seasonal significance in India.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Geographical Distribution</span>.&mdash;<i>P.
punctata</i> is widely distributed in Europe and N. America, but in the
Oriental Region it has only been found in Calcutta and the
neighbourhood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Biology</span>.&mdash;In this part of India <i>P.
punctata</i> flourishes both during the "rains" and in winter. I have
found specimens in June and July and also in December and January. The
majority of them were attached to bricks, but some were on the roots of
duckweed, the stems of water-plants, and the tips of creepers falling
into water. The species is often found together with <i>Stolella
indica</i> and also with other species of its own genus. It is most
common, in the neighbourhood of Calcutta, in that part of the town which
is near the Salt Lakes, and occurs in ponds the water of which is
slightly brackish.</p>

is formed by the great elongation of the basal part of a zo&oelig;cium,

<p>The zoaria of this subfamily are never dendritic but form gelatinous
masses which, except in <i>Australella</i>, are cushion-shaped or
sack-like. With the possible exception of <i>Australella</i>, they
possess to a limited extent the power of moving along vertical or
horizontal surfaces, but it is by no means clear how they do so (see
p.&nbsp;172). The statoblasts are remarkable for their large size, and
it is noteworthy that <i>Australella</i>, which is intermediate in
structure between the Plumatellinæ and the Lophopinæ, possesses
statoblasts of intermediate size. The swim-ring is always well
developed, and fixed statoblasts are unknown.</p>

<p>Only two genera (<i>Lophopodella</i> and <i>Pectinatella</i>) have
been definitely proved to occur in India, but a third (<i>Lophopus</i><a
name="fnanchor_BK" id="fnanchor_BK"></a><a href="#footnote_BK"

Madras. Should it be met with it will easily be recognized by the
upright position of its polypides when their tentacles are expanded and
by the fact that the statoblasts never bear marginal processes.</p>

<p><i>Zoarium.</i> The zoarium as a rule has one horizontal axis longer
than the other so that it assumes an oval form when the polypides are
expanded; when they are retracted its outline is distinctly lobular.
Viewed from the side it is mound-shaped. The polypides radiate, as a
rule in several circles, from a common centre. The ectocyst is much
swollen, hyaline and colourless.</p>

<p><i>Polypide.</i> The polypide has normally about 60 tentacles, the
velum at the base of which is narrow and by no means strongly festooned.
The stomach is yellow or greenish in colour. The extended part of the
polypide measures when fully expanded rather less than 3 mm., and each
limb of the lophophore about the same.</p>

<p><i>Statoblast.</i> The statoblast is variable in shape and size but
measures on an average about 0.85 × 0.56 mm. The ends are truncate or
subtruncate; the capsule is small as compared with the swim-ring and as
a rule circular or nearly so. The processes at the two ends are variable
in number; so also are their spinules, which are arranged in two
parallel rows, one row on each side of the process, and are neither very
numerous nor set close together; as a rule they curve round through the
greater part of a circle and are absent from the basal part of the
process.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Geographical Distribution.</span>&mdash;The

feet).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Biology.</span>&mdash;<i>L. carteri</i> is found
on the lower surface of stones and on the stems and leaves of
water-plants, usually in lakes or large ponds. Although the zoaria do
not form compound colonies by secreting a common membrane or investment,
they are markedly gregarious. The most closely congregated and the
largest zoaria I have seen were assembled amongst a gelatinous green
alga of the genus <i>Tolypothrix</i><a name="fnanchor_BM"
id="fnanchor_BM"></a><a href="#footnote_BM"
class="fnanchor"><sup>[BM]</sup></a> (Myxophyceæ) that grows on the
vertical stems of a plant at the edge of Igatpuri Lake; it is noteworthy
that in this case the alga seemed to take the place of the common
investment of <i>Pectinatella burmanica</i>, in which green cells are
present in large numbers (p.&nbsp;237). The zoaria of <i>L. carteri</i>
are able to change their position, and I found that if a number of them
were placed in a bottle of water they slowly came together at one spot,
thus apparently forming temporary compound colonies. Before a movement
of the whole zoarium commences its base becomes detached from its
support at the anterior end (fig. 32, p.&nbsp;172), but the whole action
is extremely slow and I have not been able to discover any facts that
cast light on its exact method of production. At Igatpuri statoblasts
are being produced in considerable numbers at the end of November, but
many young zoaria can be found in which none have as yet been
formed.</p>

<p>The larva of a fly of the genus <i>Chironomus</i> is often found
inhabiting a tube below zoaria of <i>L. carteri</i>. It is thus
protected from its enemies but can protrude its head from beneath the
zoarium and seize the small animals on which it preys.</p>

<p>This genus is closely allied to <i>Lophopodella</i>, from which it is
often difficult to distinguish young specimens. Adult zoaria are,
however, always embedded together in groups in a gelatinous investment
which they are thought to secrete in common<a name="fnanchor_BN"
id="fnanchor_BN"></a><a href="#footnote_BN"
class="fnanchor"><sup>[BN]</sup></a>, and the statoblasts are entirely
surrounded by processes that bear curved spinules at their tips only.
The polypides have the same semi-recumbent position as those of
<i>Lophopodella</i> but are larger than those of any species of
<i>Lophopodella</i> or <i>Lophopus</i> yet known. The statoblasts are
larger than those of any other Plumatellidæ.</p>

<p>The type-species was originally found in N. America but has since
been taken in several localities in continental Europe. Except this and
the Indian form only one species is known, namely <i>P. gelatinosa</i>
from Japan. <i>P. magnifica</i> has circular statoblasts with long
marginal processes, while in <i>P. gelatinosa</i> the statoblasts are
subquadrate and in <i>P. burmanica</i> almost circular, both Asiatic
forms having very short marginal processes.</p>

<p>The compound colonies formed by <i>Pectinatella</i> are often of
great size. Those of <i>P. gelatinosa</i> are sometimes over 2 metres in
length, while those of <i>P. burmanica</i> in the Sur Lake appeared to
be only limited as regards their growth by the shallowness of the water
in which the reeds to which they were attached were growing. Some were
observed that were over 2 feet long.</p>

<p><i>Zoarium.</i> The zoaria are circular or nearly so except when
about to undergo division, in which case they are constricted in the
middle. As a rule they measure nearly an inch (2 cm.) in<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
diameter. The polypides have a definite arrangement in each zoarium,
being divided into four groups, each of which has a fan-like form. In
the first place they are separated into two main divisions in a line
running through the centre of the zoarium, and secondly each main
division is separated into two subordinate ones in a line running across
the other at right angles. The number of zoaria joined together in a
single compound colony is very variable; sometimes there are only about
half a dozen and sometimes several hundreds. The common investment in
living colonies is often as much as two inches thick and has a
translucent dark greenish colour due to the presence in it of green
cells.</p>

shape of the statoblasts and in having much longer tentacles. The
arrangement of the polypides in the zoarium and the general structure of
the statoblasts are very similar in the two species.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Geographical Distribution.</span>&mdash;<i>P.
burmanica</i> was originally described from a swamp at Kawkareik in the
Amherst district of Tenasserim but has also been found in the Sur Lake
near Puri in Orissa. Dr. A. Willey obtained specimens from a pool by the
roadside between Maradankadewela and Galapitagala, at the foot of
Ritigala, N. Central Province, Ceylon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Biology.</span>&mdash;The first specimen obtained
was a statoblast fixed to a tube of the oligochæte worm <i>Aulophorus
tonkinensis</i> taken at Kawkareik in March. At the same time young
zoaria, which did not yet possess a common investment, were found on a
leaf growing on a twig which drooped into the water. Large compound
colonies were taken in Orissa in October. They completely encased the
stems of reeds, thus forming hollow cylinders, but slipped from their
supports when the reeds were pulled out of the water. In life they
resembled gelatinous algæ rather than animals and exhibited a striking
similarity to masses of zoaria of <i>Lophopodella carteri</i> surrounded
by such algæ. Some of the colonies were evidently dying and contained
few polypides in a living condition, but many statoblasts; others were
in a flourishing condition and were producing larvæ and statoblasts
simultaneously.</p>

<p>A piece of a colony full of larvæ was placed before midday in an
aquarium, which was kept in a shady verandah. Large numbers of larvæ
were set free almost immediately. They measured about 2 mm. in length
and were distinctly pear-shaped; each contained a pair of polypides,
which occupied a comparatively small part of the interior, the whole of
the broader half being hollow. The larvæ swam slowly, broad-end-first,
by means of the cilia with which their surface was covered, occasionally
gyrating on their long axis and always adopting an erratic course.
Towards evening they showed signs of settling down, frequently touching
the glass of the aquarium with their broad ends and sometimes remaining
still in this position for some minutes. Many attempts were, however,
made before fixation was completed, and this did not occur until after
nightfall. By next morning every larva was fixed to the glass and had
everted its two polypides. Unfortunately I was not able to trace the
development further, but young compound colonies were found in which the
secretion of the common investment had just commenced. The zoaria in
these colonies measured about 1 cm. in diameter and already contained
many polypides each.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg
238]</a></span>Oka has described the development from the statoblast of
the allied Japanese species. He found that each statoblast produced in
the first instance a single polypide, and that the statoblasts, which
were produced in autumn, lay dormant through the winter and germinated
in spring. As the Sur Lake begins to undergo desiccation as soon as the
"rains" cease, the statoblasts in it probably do not germinate until the
break of the next "rains" about the middle of June. I have had dried
statoblasts in my possession for over two years. Their cellular contents
appear to be in good condition, although the cells show no signs of
development; but they have not germinated in my aquarium, in which some
of them have now been kept for more than six months.</p>

<p>The green cells of the common investment are peculiar bodies that
deserve further study than it has yet been possible to devote to them.
Each cell is of ovoid form, varying somewhat in size but as a rule
measuring about 0.03 × 0.008 mm. There can be no doubt that these bodies
represent a stage in the life-history of an alga<a name="fnanchor_BO"

publication of this book, in the Journ. As. Soc. Bengal (1911). Prof.
West has found, associated more or less fortuitously with <i>P.

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Hints on the Preparation of
Specimens.</span></p>

<p><i>To preserve Spongillidæ.</i>&mdash;Spongillidæ must be preserved
dry or in very strong alcohol. Formalin should not be used.</p>

<p><i>To clean siliceous sponge spicules.</i>&mdash;Place small
fragments of the dried sponge (if alcohol is present, the reaction is
apt to be violent) in a test tube, cover them with strong nitric acid
and boil over the flame of a Bunsen burner or small spirit lamp until
the solid particles disappear. Add a large quantity of water to the acid
and filter through pure cellulose filter-paper, agitating the liquid
repeatedly. Pass clean water in considerable quantities through the
filter-paper and dry the latter carefully; place it in a spirally coiled
wire and ignite with a match, holding the wire in such a way that the
spicules released by the burning of the paper fall into a suitable
receptacle. They may then be picked up with a camel's-hair brush and
mounted in Canada balsam.</p>

<p><i>To examine the skeleton of a Spongillid.</i>&mdash;Cut thin
hand-sections with a sharp scalpel, dehydrate if necessary, and mount in
Canada balsam.</p>

<p><i>To prepare gemmules for examination.</i>&mdash;Place the gemmules
dry in a watch-glass with a few drops of strong nitric acid. When gas is
given off freely add water in considerable quantities. Remove the
gemmules with a camel's-hair brush to clean water, then to 50%, 70%, 90%
and absolute alcohol in succession, leaving them for an hour in each
strength of spirit. Clear with oil of cloves and mount in Canada
balsam.</p>

<p><i>To ascertain the presence of bubble-cells in the parenchyma of a
Spongillid.</i>&mdash;Tease up a small piece of the sponge with a pair
of needles, mount under a thin cover-slip in strong spirit, and examine
under a high power of the microscope.</p>

<p><i>To preserve Hydra in an expanded condition.</i>&mdash;Place the
polyp in a watch-glass of clean water and wait until its tentacles are
expanded. Heat a few drops of commercial formaldehyde and squirt the
liquid while still hot at the <i>Hydra</i>, which will be killed<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
instantaneously. Remove it to a solution of formaldehyde and spirit of
the following formula:&mdash;</p>

<table cellpadding="5" cellspacing="10" summary="formaldehyde formula">

<tr><td class="left_a">Commercial formaldehyde</td><td class="left_a">1
part.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="left_a">Absolute alcohol</td><td class="left_a">3
parts.</td></tr>

<tr><td class="left_a">Distilled water</td><td class="left_a">7
parts.</td></tr>

</table>

<p>Then pass the <i>Hydra</i> through 50% and 70% alcohol and keep in
90%.</p>

<p><i>To examine the capsules of the nettle-cells.</i>&mdash;Place a
living <i>Hydra</i> in a small drop of water on a slide and press a thin
cover-slip down upon it.</p>

<p><i>To preserve freshwater polyzoa in an expanded
condition.</i>&mdash;Place the polyzoa in a glass tube full of clean
water and allow them to expand their tentacles. Drop on them gradually
when they are fully expanded a 2% aqueous solution of cocaine, two or
three drops at a time, until movement ceases in the tentacles. Then pour
commercial formaldehyde into the tube in considerable quantities. Allow
the whole to stand for half an hour. If it is proposed to stain the
specimens for anatomical investigation, they should then be removed
through 50% and 70% to 90% alcohol. If, on the other hand, it is desired
to keep them in a life-like condition they may be kept permanently in a
solution of one part of commercial formaldehyde in four parts of water.
Care must be taken that the process of paralyzing the polypides is not
unduly prolonged, and it is always as well to preserve duplicate
specimens in spirit or formalin with the lophophore retracted.</p>

<p><i>To prepare statoblasts for examination.</i>&mdash;Place the
statoblasts for a few minutes in strong nitric acid. Then remove the
acid with water, pass through alcohol, clear with oil of cloves, and
mount in a small quantity of Canada balsam under a cover-slip, taking
care that the statoblasts lie parallel to the latter.</p>

<h3 class="p4">ADDENDA.</h3>

<p class="p2">The following addenda are due mainly to an expedition to
the lakes of Kumaon in the W. Himalayas undertaken by Mr. S. W. Kemp in
May, 1911.</p>

<p class="p2 center">PART I.</p>

<p class="center">Genus <b>SPONGILLA</b>.</p>

<p class="center">Subgenus <b>EUSPONGILLA</b> (p.&nbsp;<a

<p>Specimens were taken in the lake Malwa Tal (alt. 3600 feet) in
Kumaon, while others have recently been obtained from the Kalichedu
irrigation-tank in the Pagnor <i>talug</i> of the Nellore district,
Madras (<i>G. H. Tipper</i>).</p>

<p class="center">4. <b>Spongilla cinerea</b> (p.&nbsp;<a
href="#Page_79">79</a>).</p>

<p>Specimens were taken in Naukuchia Tal (alt. 4200 feet) in Kumaon.
They have a pale yellow colour when dry. This sponge has not hitherto
been found outside the Bombay Presidency.</p>

<p class="center">Subgenus <b>EUNAPIUS</b> (p.&nbsp;<a
href="#Page_86">86</a>).</p>

<p class="center">8. <b>Spongilla carteri</b> (p.&nbsp;<a

<p>Specimens were taken in Bhim Tal (alt. 4450 feet) and Sat Tal (alt.
4500 feet). Some of them approach the variety <i>cava</i> in
structure.</p>

<p class="center">Subgenus <b>STRATOSPONGILLA</b> (p.&nbsp;<a

<p>Add a new variety:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">13 a. Var. <b>pneumatica</b>, nov.</p>

<p>This variety differs from the typical form in the following
characters:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote_b">(i.) The sponge forms a flat layer of a pale
brownish colour as a rule with short and very delicate vertical
branches.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg

attached, only at the base, to a slender twig.</p>

<p class="blockquote_b">(ii.) The gemmules are covered, outside the
spicules, by a thick pneumatic coat of irregular formation and with
comparatively large air-spaces.</p>

<p class="blockquote_b">(iii.) The gemmule-spicules are regularly
sausage-shaped.</p>

<p class="blockquote">[Many more references to this common species might
be cited, but those given above will be sufficient.]</p>

<p>This species only differs from <i>E. meyeni</i> in the following
characters:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquote_b">(i.)   there are no bubble-cells in the
parenchyma;</p>

<p class="blockquote_b">(ii.)  there is less spongin in the skeleton,
which is less compact;</p>

<p class="blockquote_b">(iii.) the gemmule-spicules are longer, the
shafts being as a rule longer than the diameter of the rotulæ;</p>

<p class="blockquote_b"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243"
id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>(iv.) the gemmules are armed with a
single row of regularly arranged spicules embedded in pneumatic tissue
with minute air-spaces.</p>

<p>The sponge is a variable one and several "varieties" have been
described from different parts of the world. My Indian specimens come
nearest to the form described by Potts as <i>Meyenia robusta</i>, but
have rather more slender skeleton-spicules and more elongate
gemmule-spicules. The latter also appear to be less frequently
"monstrous."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Type</span> ?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Geographical Distribution.</span>&mdash;<i>E.
fluviatilis</i> is widely distributed in Europe and occurs in N.
America,<a name="fnanchor_BP" id="fnanchor_BP"></a><a
href="#footnote_BP" class="fnanchor"><sup>[BP]</sup></a> S. Africa (var.
<i>capensis</i>, Kirkpatrick), Australia, and Japan. Specimens were
obtained by Mr. Kemp from several lakes in Kumaon, namely Naukuchia Tal
(alt. 4200 feet), Bhim Tal (4450 feet), Sat Tal (4500 feet), and Naini
Tal (6300 feet). The gemmules from Bhim Tal referred by me to <i>E.
robusta</i> (Potts) also belong to this species.</p>

<p><i>Biology.</i> The external form of the sponge is due in great part
to its environment. Specimens on small stones from the bottom of the
Kumaon Lakes consist of thin disk-like films, often not more than a few
centimetres in diameter and a few millimetres thick: others, growing on
thin twigs, are elevated and compressed, resembling a cockscomb in
appearance, while others again form nodules and masses of irregular form
among the branches of delicate water-weeds. Some of these last are
penetrated by zoaria of <i>Fredericella indica</i>.</p>

<p>Weltner has published some very interesting observations on the
seasonal variation of minute structure in European representatives of
the species (Arch. Naturg. Berlin, lxxiii (i), p.&nbsp;273 1907) and has
discussed the formation of the abnormal spicules that sometimes occur
(<i>ibid.</i> lxvii (Special Number), p.&nbsp;191, pls. vi, vii, figs.
27-59, 1901).</p>

<p class="p2 center">Genus <b>CORVOSPONGILLA</b> (p.&nbsp;<a
href="#Page_122">122</a>).</p>

<p>After <i>Corvospongilla burmanica</i>, p.&nbsp;123, add a new
species:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><b>Corvospongilla caunteri</b>, nov.</p>

<p><i>Sponge</i> forming thin films of considerable area not more than 3
or 4 mm. thick, of a bright green colour, moderately hard but friable.
The surface smooth; oscula inconspicuous, surrounded by shallow and
ill-defined radiating furrows; a very stout basal membrane present.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg

<p><i>Spicules.</i> Skeleton-spicules variable in size and shape, almost
straight, as a rule smooth, moderately stout, blunt or abruptly pointed;
sometimes roughened or spiny at the tips, often sharply pointed.
Flesh-spicules minute, few in number, with smooth, slender shafts which
are variable in length, never very strongly curved; the terminal spines
relatively short, not strongly recurved. Gemmule-spicules
amphistrongylous or <ins title="changed from
'amphioxus'">amphioxous</ins>, irregularly spiny, slender, of variable
length.</p>

<p><i>Gemmules</i> free in the substance of the sponge, spherical or
somewhat depressed, very variable in size but never large, having a
thick external pneumatic coat in which the air-spaces are extremely
small and, inside this coat, a single rather sparse layer of spicules
lying parallel to the gemmule. A single depressed aperture present.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Habitat.</span> Hazratganj, Lucknow; on piers of
bridge in running water (<i>J. Caunter</i>, 29-30. iv. 11).</p>

<p>The structure of the gemmules of this species differs considerably
from that in any other known species of the genus, in which these
structures are usually adherent and devoid of a true pneumatic coat. In
some of the gemmules before me this coat measures in thickness about 1/9
of the total diameter of the gemmule. <i>C. caunteri</i> is the first
species of <i>Corvospongilla</i> to be found in the Indo-Gangetic
plain.</p>

<p class="p2 center">PART II.</p>

<p class="center">Genus <b>HYDRA</b> (p.&nbsp;<a
href="#Page_147">147</a>).</p>

<p>25. <b>Hydra oligactis</b> (p.&nbsp;<a href="#Page_158">158</a>).</p>

<p>Mr. Kemp found this species common in Bhim Tal in May. His specimens,
which were of a reddish-brown colour in life, appear to have been of
more vigorous constitution than those taken by Major Stephenson in
Lahore. Some of them had four buds but none were sexually mature.</p>

<p class="p2 center">PART III.</p>

<p class="center">Genus <b>FREDERICELLA</b> (p.&nbsp;<a
href="#Page_208">208</a>).</p>

<p>28. <b>Fredericella indica</b> (p.&nbsp;<a
href="#Page_210">210</a>).</p>

<p>This species is common in some of the Kumaon lakes, in which it
grows, at any rate at the beginning of summer, much more luxuriantly
than it does in the lakes of the Malabar Zone in autumn, forming dense
bushy masses on the under surface of stones, on sticks, &amp;c.  The
vertical branches often consist of many zo&oelig;cia. Mr. Kemp took
specimens in Malwa Tal, Sath Tal, and Naini Tal (alt. 3600-6300
feet).</p>

<p class="p2 center">Genus <b>PLUMATELLA</b> (p.&nbsp;<a

<p>30. <b>Plumatella emarginata</b> (p.&nbsp;<a

<p>Mr. Kemp took bushy masses of this species in Malwa Tal and Bhim
Tal.</p>

<p>32. <b>Plumatella diffusa</b> (p.&nbsp;<a

<p>This species is common in Malwa Tal and Bhim Tal in May.</p>

href="#Page_224">224</a>).</p>

<p>Mr. Kemp only found this species in Malwa Tal, in which (at any rate
in May) it appears to be less abundant than it is in Bhim Tal in autumn.
Mr. Kemp's specimens belong to the form called <i>P. elegans</i> by
Allman.</p>

<p>34. <b>Plumatella tanganyikæ</b> (p.&nbsp;<a
href="#Page_225">225</a>).</p>

<p>Specimens taken by Mr. Kemp, somewhat sparingly, in Bhim Tal and Sath
Tal in May exhibit a somewhat greater tendency towards uprightness of
the zo&oelig;cia than those I found in autumn in Igatpuri lake. The
ectocyst is, in the former specimens, of a deep but bright
reddish-brown. The zoaria are attached to twigs and small stones.</p>

<p class="p2 center">Genus <b>STOLELLA</b> (p.&nbsp;<a
href="#Page_229">229</a>).</p>

<p>After Stolella indica, p.&nbsp;229, add a new species:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><b>Stolella himalayana</b>, nov.</p>

<p>This species may be distinguished from <i>S. indica</i> by (i) its
entirely recumbent zo&oelig;cia, and (ii) the lateral branches of its
zoarium.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="captionj">A. The greater part of a young zoarium. B. Part of a
much older zoarium.</p>

<p><i>Zoarium</i> entirely recumbent, consisting of zo&oelig;cia joined
together, often in groups of three, by slender, transparent, tubular
processes. These processes are often of great relative length; they are
formed by a modification of the posterior or proximal part of the
zo&oelig;cia, from which they are not separated by a partition, and they
increase in length up to a certain point more rapidly than<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span> the
zo&oelig;cia proper. A zo&oelig;cium often gives rise first to an
anterior daughter-zo&oelig;cium, the proximal part of which becomes
elongate and attenuated in due course, and then to a pair of lateral
daughter-zo&oelig;cia situated one on either side. As a result of this
method of budding a zoarium with a close superficial resemblance to that
of <i>Paludicella</i> is at first produced, but as the colony increases
in age and complexity this resemblance largely disappears, for the
zo&oelig;cia and their basal tubules grow over one another and often
become strangely contorted (fig. 49).</p>

<p><i>Zo&oelig;cia</i> elongate and slender, flattened on the ventral,
strongly convex on the dorsal surface; rather deep in proportion to
their breadth; the ectocyst colourless, not very transparent except on
the stolon-like tubular part; dorsal keel and furrow as a rule absent;
orifice unusually inconspicuous, situated on a tubercle on the dorsal
surface.</p>

<p><i>Polypide</i> stout and short; the tip of the fundus of the stomach
capable of very complete constriction; the retractor muscles unusually
short and stout.</p>

<p><i>Statoblasts.</i> Only free statoblasts have been observed. They
resemble those of <i>S. indica</i>, but are perhaps a little longer and
more elongate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Types</span> in the Indian Museum.</p>

<p>The discovery of this species makes it necessary to modify the
diagnosis of the genus, the essential character of which, as
distinguishing it from <i>Plumatella</i>, is the differentiation of the
proximal part of some or all of the zo&oelig;cia to form stolon-like
tubules. From <i>Stephanella</i>, Oka, it is distinguished by the
absence of a gelatinous covering, and by the fact that all the
zo&oelig;cia are attached, at least at the base, to some extraneous
object.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Habitat.</span> Malwa Tal, Kumaon (alt. 3600
feet), W. Himalayas (<i>Kemp</i>, May 1911).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Biology.</span> Mr. Kemp took three specimens,
all attached to the lower surface of stones. They contained few
statoblasts and were evidently in a condition of vigorous growth.
Between the lateral branches new polyparia were developing in several
instances from free statoblasts, each of which appeared to contain two
polypides.</p>

<h3>Transcriber's Note:</h3>

<p>In the Systematic Index, pages vii-viii, sub-family items were
renumbered from 15. through 38., to correspond to the numbers used in
the text of the book. Letters missing or mis-typeset were inserted, e.g.

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">http://www.gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
